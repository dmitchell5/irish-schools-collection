Thick green rushes were chosen and they were peeled leaving a narrow strip to form a support.  The rushes were dipped in oil or melted fat.

Then thin strips of calico or other material were cut.  Then the strips were dipped in the resin. Then they were taken out and rolled on a board until they were made into long sticks.  The candle sticks were made of iron on the top with wood underneath. The iron was made so as to open in and out like a nippers. The candles generally used were three rush candles plaited together.{Francie Browne from his grandmother, Mrs Susan Rynn, Aughrim.}\n\n\n\nAbout seventy years ago a substitute for soap was used.

A pound of borax dissolved in warm water and stirred in a newly made barrel of soft-soap before putting it away will save three fourths of the labour of washing. The water is thus softened and the fabric will be much whiter and cleaner. it takes only about one half hour to make the nice white soap, and after it is made it should be left to dry for several weeks before using, when it will become hard and white.\n\n\n\nOld Crafts.Nearly everyone in our district had their own lime kiln long ago and they always burned their own lime.
