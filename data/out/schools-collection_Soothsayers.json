There is no foundation for either of these tales.Sir Walter's first appearance in Carbery affairs was as a mortagee of the lands and castle of Cloghane.

It is said that Sir Walter intended to build a market town there and turn the Rowry into a canal.If tradition may be relied on, Sir Walter was a cruel despot, and fireside yarns are told of his dark deeds, executions and imprisonments. There is a local tradition that he died of an apoplectic fit brought on by passion as he was leaving church one Sunday.Downeen Castle believed to have been built by the O'Cowhigs on a rocky portion of land on the coast and separated from the mainland, so that there was no getting into it except over a drawbridge\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Clochar na Tr\u00f3caire, Ros \u00d3 gCairbre", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ross Carbery, Co.
