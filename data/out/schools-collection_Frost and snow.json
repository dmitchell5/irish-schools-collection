One farmer lost twenty sheep out on the Wicklow Mountains. Other livestock suffered terrible hardships.Large numbers of people lost their lives in the floods which followed the snowstorm. The country was isolated for months after., Food was transported to the people by air. Afterwards there followed great diseases to both men and beasts.

Two boys of about sixteen years of age named Denis Sinnott and Tom Kenny, Stoney, Carne, came down to the lake and like all boys, went sliding on the ice. They were about 50 yards from the shore, when the ice broke and they both went down.Tom Kenny managed to scramble to the shore, but Denis was left hanging to the edge of the ice, for over half-an-hour. Soon some neighbours came with a ladder and brought him ashore. He had a narrow escape, but he was never the same after.
