In each kitchen there was a space in the form of angle protruding outward where some member of the family slept.  This was known as a \"caileach\" in Irish.  There was a space in the wall over the fire place for a salt box in each house.  A salt box was a very common present given to people when going to live in a new house.  Behind each door there was a type of crate made of straw known as a \"puca\".  Here the hens layed.  At each fire place there was a \"suisteog\" (a type of chair made of plaited straw) for the woman of the house.  All the kitchen utensils were so made of oak cups, sycamore plates.

There were no chimneys on these houses, but holes used to be made in the gables. They were thatched iwth rushes, and tied with straw ropes to pegs in the walls. There was only one room and it was usual to see a horse or a cow tied to the lower gable. The pigs used to be under the bed in corner. There was also a roost in the end of the house on which the hens stayed for the night. There was very little furniture in those houses. Small boxes were used for sitting on, and a big box took the place of a table. it was the custom also to put false-windows in the houses. This was done to avoid paying window tax.Rushes dipped in tallow took the place of a lamp.

Monaghan is that they make turf.  Usually turf is cut.  This turf is called mud-turf that they make and it makes a very good fire and is easy to light.  This is how it is made.The first thing they do is dig away the \"scraw\". Then they dig up the first layer of the clay.  This is called \"the fum\", because it is useless.  They dig another layer of clay.  This is called a \"floor\".  It is too crumbly to cut into squares so they break it with spades.  Then water is thrown on it and men come and mix it up with shovels.  Two men go into it with graipes and take the sticks out of it.  This is called \"dragging\".  Then it is wheeled out to a good dry level bank.  Another floor is dug.  They dig another and another till they have five floors dug and there is nothing left but sand.  The same thing is done with every floor.Then two men come and \"bake\" the turf.  That is they go through it with their hands and make squares like pan loaves.  Water is thrown into the squares, so that they will not join together again.  In a week or ten days men come back with spades and turns them up on their ends.  After a few weeks they come and \"foot\" the turf.  That is they set eight turfs in the form of a wee house.  Then they are put into wind-rows so that they will dry.  When they are dry they are put into small clamps.  In the summer when the men have time they come with carts and draw them home.

They were nearly all thatched, and they were a lot better made, and they looked far better than any of the houses that are built nowadays. In some places the roofs of the old houses were flat, and there was a hole left on the roof for the smoke to get out, and they had no chimneys on them, and they were generally made of mortar and stones. The houses were thatched with rye-straw, which the people grew and thrashed with a flail. Most of the old houses had a bed in the kitchen which was called a settle-bed, this was generally against the back-wall of the kitchen under the back-window. The fire-place was generally against the side-wall, and in some places it was on the middle of the floor. The floors were made from yellow clay, and it was very seldom that concrete floors were made. Half-doors were very common long ago, but they are almost gone out of fashion now. Turf was the usual material for the fire, or if the turf was very wet wood was used but very seldom coal was used.

The chimney was at one end, and the fire was on the ground - no grates being used.Some of the cabins had half doors.

The common kind of thatch used were rushes and sedges.The dearer kind of thatch was wheaten straw.  The people who used to grow wheat, sold the straw. A thatcher was employed to do this work.

They were very small.  They were all built of mud and stones mixed together, and the roofs were thatched.  The people did not know anything about cement at that time.  The windows were very small.  There were two reasons for having small windows.  The windows were taxed, which was one reason.  At that time robbers were going about and the people were afraid for fear they would break in during the night.The houses were built so small at that time that the large families had to have one bed in the kitchen. The bed they kept in the kitchen was called a \"settle\" bed. It could be made into the shape of a box in the day, and a bed by night.  It was made by a spring held on by hinges.  It was placed near the wall.Some people had the fire place at the gable wall, and many of them had against the side wall.  My grandfather told me that he often saw the fire in the middle of the floor. He also told me that some of the people had no chimneys.  The smoke had to go out the door.  The floors were made of mud.  All the houses were thatched.  They used to get rushes growing near the river, and use it for thatching the house.  Wheaten straw was also used, but it was very dear.On account of the windows being so small the houses were badly lighted.  This was the cause of giving the people bad sight.  Half doors were common in the former times.  There are still some half doors to be seen.  There are some to be seen at the present day at the left hand side of this village.At that time coal was not in use,    and the people did not know anything about it.

When Cashel was taken over in Cromwells time they bought a number of firkins of tallow seized by the Cromwellians on the Rock of Cashel. On examining the firkins they found that each firkin was filled with gold overlaid with tallow. This founded their fortunes, and they acquired much land. One of the Prices was summoned on Fr Sheehy's jury and refused to act being fined one thousand pounds. One branch of the family is Catholic and reside in Co. Kildare.There is a well in Coleraine called Drohilla. It is said that an evil woman once washed her child in this well and the well removed, breaking up a short distance away, the old well becoming dry. This well is in a grove called now Quinns Grove.\n\n\n\nThere were many houses in the district long ago. James Wallace lived just above the school on the same side.

When they were in a lonely part of the road he unexpectedly threw him off the car and the wheel went over his legs but did not break them.

People who improve their houses or build news ones are always sure to meet with losses and crosses.  \"That you may build\" is a curse.  \"And there is no luck without muck\" is a common saying.Lately in Drumbar Owen McGovern built his house on the old stand but added a bit to its length.  People said it was unlucky.  What happened but the best cow he had in the world dropped dead when she was getting a drink - Its work of the Good People I suppose.  People are afraid to improve their dwellings, with fear of bad luck.A New House should be sprinkled with salt and then Holy Water to keep spirits away.  If there is a ghost in it people always get mass said in it before they sleep in it at all.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Tiercahan", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Tircahan, Co.

It is likely that the latter was the chief cause for small windows because there were iron bars protecting them outside. The mud walls were made by mixing stiff blue clay and straw and this was built up two feet wide making an airtight and substantial wall. Rafters were made from old bog beans raised on the bog where they lay, some people say since Noah's flood. There were not nails used to put them together there were pins used of the same material and put through the pieces by piercing holes to fit them.

They were made of rods twisted in and out through each other. Their principal [?] was for storing potatoes. Other lofts were made by putting two poles from the opposite walls and throwing branches across them. In other cases they were boarded and were used as bedrooms. In these thatched houses they all had a bed in the kitchen. It used to be by the wall. It served as a piece of furniture in the day time. It was called a \"Settle Bed\".

They were nearly all thatched. What they used for thatching was - wheaten straw. No other straw was used. The walls were made from a yellow clay they got in the district. Mixed with that was hay and straw and sometimes hair. They made the walls with that and as stones were very scarce they only put a few stones here and there to make them strong.  They put sticks standing upright through the walls to keep them in their places. The floors were nearly all clayed with a flag in front of the fire for a hearthstone. Flags were more plentiful at that time than stones. Men had to work for a week or fortnight and their payment would be a large flag. The windows were protected by putting iron bars outside the window and sometimes on the inside. The windows altogether were very small. Inside the doors were iron bars that when the door was closed the iron bards closed over the door and it could not open.When men earned the flag they would bring it home for a hearthstone or a bench for holding brackets or crocks. When mud walls were being built they only built a foot in a week. They had to let it dry and set before they built any more. In other parts of the country they cut boughs from on ash tree. They didn't dress them but just brought them home and put them up. They made a hole in the wood into which they put wooden pegs to keep them together.\n", "school_info": "School: Ardcath", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ardcath, Co.

They had a settle bed in this room and another ordinary iron bedstead in a corner so that at night when the \"box-bed\" was \"let down\" there was barely room enough for two to stand on the floor.Most of these old cabins were thatched but I know just one that had slates. This one still stands and has some slates on it still far in on Rosmeer bog.Many of the old houses long ago had no chimneys; the smoke came out through a hole in the roof. Others had no glass i the tiny windows and in winter time rags and papers were stuck in the apertures to keep out the cold. The floors were all of clay, and nearly every house had a half-door. They are common enough still about here. Everyone used turf and sticks for fuel; coal was almost unheard of by most of them.I have never heard of anyone in this locality using rushlights, dips, etc. to show light at night.

The man with the slain throws up the turf to town other men. Then the two men leave it in heaps to dry. There are three different layers of turf on the bog, the white turf, the brown turf and the stone turf. The different layers are left in separate heaps.

The common type of house was the thatched one.  It was a one-storeyed building containing two rooms and a kitchen.  The kitchen was used for cooking and for eating in, and often contained a bed which was called a settle-bed.  It was on hinges and could be closed in the day and left open at night when in use.  When closed during the day the bench or ledge of the settle-bed could be used as a sort of side-table or shelf for holding kitchen utensils, or it could be used even for a seat.  Besides these advantages it was a warm type of ted, being constructed entirely of wood - with the exception of the two strong hinges and two clasps to keep it closed.  Furthermore when shut up it occupied comparatively little floor space.

In the smaller houses there were usually two or three apartments, although some of them had only one.  Outside and inside, the walls were white washed which made them look very clean and white.

Then he employs a boy to catch each sod which he cuts and the boy places it on a turf barrow.  He has another man to wheel the turf away and put it on the spreading bank.  Then the boy has another barrow filled with turf by the time the man is back with the other barrow and by this way they get through the work quicker.  Some men have an ass and cart instead of a barrow.When the turf is about a week cut it is spread thinly to dry.Then it is put in small heaps called footings then it is put into larger ones.  When it is dry enough to burn it is drawn home on carts and put in the shed or made into a large rick.

The people made most of the things themselves, and many things they did without.There were a lot of old houses in this district up to a few years agoAt present they are being knocked down and modern houses are being built in their places.  The old houses were made of yellow clay mixed with straw and stones.  The very first houses that were built had only one room, but later on they had one or two other rooms adjoining the first one.The roofs were thatched with strong straw.  These roofs are still to be seen in the country.

It was 300 years old and he remembers it stuck in the roof but it got lost when he was getting the new roof on. He doesn't know at all what happened it.

In the evening when the children were going home from school the used to go in and ask the woman of the house for a drink and she used to get pewter mugs off the dresser and give them a drink.Another old house stood in Graigue more.

They were made of stone and the walls were at least eighteen inches thick so that any rain or dampness could not get through them.   The roofs were thatched, some of the wealthier folk had them slated. The floors were made of clay. Some people had only one room in the kitchen. A small hole in the wall was their window. In bad weather they kept this stuffed with rags, and paper, and in fine weather they took out the paper and rags so as to give them light.   The people made candles of their own as it was the only kind of light they could afford. They made them with fat and poured the tallow into a shape, and ran a string through it hardened after a while and they were able to use it as a candle. They only lit candles seldom as the vir which they got in the bog sent a glowing light round the kitchen.   When they went \"sgoireacting\" they took a sod of turf which was left behind the fire, and turned a couple of times till the fire got into it. This they held with an instrument like a tongs to light them over the hillside paths. These often fell asunder and left them wandering over the hillside. They are not as safe as the lanterns of to day. Sometimes they blamed Jack o' the lantern for leading them astray.

The turf was first drawn  to the main road from the mountain in half-loads known as \"Taosc\u00e1ns\".Previously people paid George Carleton  Footte, the owner of the mountain at so much a \"Cish\". He,  Footte, employed his land steward and later a local man in order to value the amount of turf each person had cut.Now the people pay the Land Commission who have  forestry near by.The spade used locally for cutting turf is called a \"Gruibeen\" and is made by the local smiths, Magners, from new digging spades.\n", "school_info": "School: Cill an Mhuilinn, Malla", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Killavullen, Co.

The old people used to have a barrel permanently fixed in a house, to take the grain from the straw used in thatching. They beat the heads of the straw on the top of the barrel. The grain fell in, and the straw was not broken. The quantity needed for thatching was threshed in this way. A timber settle bed was kept in the kitchen, and used as a seat by day. One may be seen in almost every farmer's house in this parish. At night a bottle was procured, and filled with oil. A small round cotton wick was put into this. The wick was held in place at the mouth of the bottle, by means of a pin, or needle. It was then lighted and as the wick burned, the pin, or needle was moved to a lower position.
