He set the dogs after her thinking it was a natural hare. The hare made for the mountains and made for a little hut. When the hare was going in the door of the hut the dogs caught her by the leg, but she escaped. When the man went into the hut there was an old hag inside and her leg all torn.

We are told that in olden times it was a favourite meeting place of Fionn Mac Cool and the Fianna. Deer was then plentiful in that district, so the Fianna never wanted for food or spot. One day, while traversing the district they espied a deer and immediately gave chase. The fleetfooted deer, however, made efforts to escape and succeeded in reaching the banks of the river Blackwater, before the hounds. He plunged into the water followed by the hounds in full cry. Urged on by the cries of the men the dogs battled against the strong currents in pursuit of their prey. The deer succeeded in reaching the opposite bank, but all the hounds were drowned with the exception of Bran, Fionn Mac Cool's dog.    Hence the name - Convamore, translated from the Irish - \"The great drowning of the hounds.\"\n", "school_info": "School: Baile Caisle\u00e1in an R\u00f3istigh (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Castletownroche, Co.

Amid the noise of the storm he heard a very small and delicate sound as of sweet music. He heard a knocking at the door and when he opened it he was at first dazzled with the flood of light which came in through the door. Then he perceived a woman standing there tall and beautiful with a closed basket in her hand and said - I have brought these to thee O' Finn for I have always heard that cousins should be cousinly. The woman departed and he saw her no more. When he drew back in the cabin he opened the basket and found in it two puppies of the same size.
