Soon the cow stopped giving milk and the man got suspicious of the hare. At last he took it into his head to kill the hare.  He gathered a crowd of men with guns and hounds and surrounded the hare but she miraclously escaped.  She was surrounded again and fired at but it seemed that lead would not kill her.  That night the hare was seen in the field again.  Next day the men surrounded the hare again but without success.  When evening came the hare got tired the men got round her in a bog.  Every man but one fired at her but she escaped.  This man had quicksilver in his gun so he fired at her and broke her leg.  There was a ring of whins near and inside the ring of whins was a ring of whitethorns and inside the whitethorns was a little house covered with the whitethorns.  The wounded hare crawled into this.  The men followed and found an old woman with her leg bleeding.  They could not kill her because she was an old woman.  A month later she died and a hundred black hounds were seen to go round the house three times and disappear.

The next morning they were eating their breakfast and the cock came into the kitchen. The woman got a great surprise when she saw the strange cock because she thought it was death. \"O\" she said to the cock \"run away and take himself with you\"There was a servant boy working in his house + his mistress was supposed to have a hand in with the fairies. When May night came all the family were put to bed earlier than usual. The servant boy said to himself that there was something something wrong. She went around about 12 oclock to see if they were all asleep. The servant pretended to be asleep. When she thought they were asleep she jumped up + took down a box from behind the rafters. She smeared herself all over with the stuff from the box. She was then in the form of a hare: When she was gone he hoped up on the table and found the box + smeared himself with it + he was in the form of a hare. He ran out also.
