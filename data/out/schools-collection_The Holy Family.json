On the way Mary got thirsty and there was no water to be found.  In the wood was a cherry tree with ripe fruit on it but Mary could not reach to it.  She asked someone to pull down the tree but the person refused.  Then the tree bent down and Mary got the cherries.  Ever since then cherries are the first fruit ripens and the fruit always hangs downwards.Another story is:  When the Holy Family were in Egypt Herod's soldiers were after them to try and kill Our Lord.  When They were hiding They went in to a cave for safety.  A spider wove her web over the mouth of the cave.  The soldiers came along and looked into the cave and when they saw the web was not broken they said no one went down there, so they passed on.  In this way the spider saved Our Lord.  It is said it is not right to kill a spider.\n", "school_info": "School: Summerville", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Summerville, Co.

Our Lord then passed on after this conversation and journeyed on until he came to a small but clean cabin and entered it. Shortly after his entrance a spider commenced to cover the window panes with web. During this process the soldiers had arrived at the corn field in which the corn was now being reaped after having been sown but the night before. They asked the reaper if he had seen the Rabbi passing by. The reaper answered \"he passed this way while I was sowing this corn\"  The soldiers at first did not believe him but eventually went on their way.Just as they were about to leave the reaper, a small insect known as a \"clock\" crossed his path and uttered the words \"nay, nay\". The soldiers again questioned the reaper but he convinced them of the truth. On they went until they came in sight of the cabin.
