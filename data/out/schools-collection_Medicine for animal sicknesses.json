Mr. Collins cut some branches of blackthorn bushes, selected the most bulky, and cut them into lengths of about 4 inches. He put about two pounds of these blackthorn stumps into a pot and put sufficient water in to cover them.  He then put it to boil and simmer over the fire for about two hours. Then he dosed the animal with the liquid in the pot, and placed the pot under the animals head - seemingly that it should inhale the vapour from the boiled blackthorn.
