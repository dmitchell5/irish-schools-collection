It happened to be the last day in January They were travelling all night and they were getting little things for the poor. They came to a house. They went in and Brigid asked the woman of the house for a drink. She said she would give her the drink. She put down a burner of milk and when it was warm she gave it to Brigid. Brigid would not take it because God made known to her that the woman had poison in the milk. The man of the house asked her why she did that. She told him that there was poison in it.  He asked the woman why she put poison in it. She told him that Brigid had a gold cross and if she drank it she would die and she would have the cross. The woman then threw herself down at Brigid's feet. Brigid never wore the cross outside after that. Then the people went around to houses that night ever since that\n", "school_info": "School: Eaglais", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Burren, Co.

It was customary for young boys to dress up in old clothes and cover their faces with masks, and go from house to house collecting money for St. Brigid. They go in groups of six or seven and each party has a musician of some kind who plays while the others dance. They are called Breedogues. When they had travelled for miles, they drew to some farmer's house and held which is generally known as Breedoges Space, which was paid for out of the collection made.

The well is situated at the base of a gentle slope which is covered with shrubs and bushes. The rock is bare in front of the well to the South, and a white-thorn bush, which is nearly all gone now as souvenirs, shelters it from the North.There is no protecting wall round the well and cattle drink from it. It is shaped somewhat like a segment of a circle whose chord forms the front, or South side of the well.The sides and bottom are rock and the well is only about 18'' deep. Yet this well never dries up completely. Water taken from the well may be used for drinking purposes, but owing to the fact that cattle use the well it is not now used for drinking purposes except by pilgrims.Three-quarters of a mile nearer Ballinamore is the graveyard of Oughteraugh (Upper Field) in the townland of Tarmon. In this graveyard a church dedicated to St. Bridget once stood. Oughteraugh is the name of the parish in which all these places are situated.When the Protestant Church at Ballinamore, was being built the roof was off the old church at Oughteraugh\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: B\u00e9al an \u00c1tha M\u00f3ir (B.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ballinamore, Co.

Years ago  it was customary for young men to dress up in disguise and visit all the houses in the locality. They brought with them the effigy of St Bridget. Good wishes and blessings, were given to each householder. Sometimes dance was indulged in, and as a token, a pin or some other sign was given by the woman of the house. Later on the sticking of pins on the effigy ceased and money was given instead. This money was used for some pious or charitable purpose.

A man and his wife lived in it, and they said, \"to be sure, we will put you up for the night\"The reason they kept them was, St. Brigid had a gold cross in her breast, and the man, who  was a robber, wanted to steal it, and he planned to give her poison to drink, and when he gave it to her she said, \"take a drink yourself\"He obeyed her and took it. The Saint then made the sign of the cross and banished the poison from her drink into his.
