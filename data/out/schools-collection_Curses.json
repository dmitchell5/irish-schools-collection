The poor widow of Mr x-, now grown old, saw the deceit of their uncle and guardian, and understood his motive quite well. She remonstrated with him on behalf of his brother's children but it was of no avail, he determined to have the farm for his own children, and so he had.According to tradition the poor old widow cursed the farm and prayed that none of the grabber's family may own the place. This occurred three generations ago, and today no relative (much less a member) of the family live there. The last member of the family to own the place (Mrs -) a granddaughter of the unfaithful guardian, on her husband's death wouldn't continue to live there for all the gold in the world to use her own expression and sold the place and now resides a few miles away.\n", "school_info": "School: Cnoc na Sn\u00e1 (B.), Mainistir na F\u00e9ile", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Knocknasna, Co.
