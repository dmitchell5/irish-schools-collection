All went well until those two unfortunates struck a match to set the petrol on Fire.Immediately an explosion took place: all the doors closed trapping poor John Byrne and Peter Hunt. They were badly bunt when rescued. John Byrne, whose heat was not so good, died from shock, the following day, and Peter Hunt survived, but was greatly marked around the face and neck.The site where this stood was afterwards bought for \u00a310.
