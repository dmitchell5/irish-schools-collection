The inscriptions on these headstones tell of families who lived in the locality in days gone bye and are forgotten, except to some few very old residents of the town whose memories carried them back sixty or perhaps seventy years to the days of their childhood. All that now remains of these old families, many of whom played or not unimportant part in the struggle for Irish freedom in the days when it was not so popular to espouse the cause of Nationality as it is to-day. These people risked all they possessed and often life itself in defiance of the English oppressor. Many of these humble graves hold the remains of the Gallant men who fought in 1798 at Vinegar Hill and New Ross, and side by side with them can be seen the graves and imposing headstones of the men of the Pale who opposed the English Garrison in Ireland down even to our own days.John O LohanThomas O LohanFarrell StreetKells\n", "school_info": "School: Ceannanus M\u00f3r, Scoil na mBr\u00e1thar", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Kells, Co.

He was very thirsty and seeing a little cottage by the way he went in and asked the woman of the house for a drink of water. The woman received him kindly but she said that she was afraid she could only give him bog-water to drink as there was not a well round there. St Columcille took the water and drank it and then he told the woman that she would never be short of spring-water again. When he was going he struck the ground with his staff and a fountain of lovely fresh water spurted forth from the ground. It is called by the same name which that family put on it down to this day. Years later it was found that this well had the power of curing blindness and other diseases and a pilgrimage was formed to visit this well every year.
