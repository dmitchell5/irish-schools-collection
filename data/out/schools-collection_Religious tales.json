When seagulls assemble on land storm and wet weather are approaching and the curlew with its peculiar cry foretells wet weather and storm. When the crows are lined along ditches and on the road it is a sign of wet weather too.\n\n\n\nLong long ago when Our Saviour died a robin saw him bleeding [and?] dipped its breast in His blood and since that all robins have red breasts.It is said that another time when Our Lord was hiding from the Jews that the robin hid Him by covering Him with leaves. But the wren [give] gave the Jews some sign and the got Our Lord.\n\n\n\nSome people would tell you that it is not right to let a wren build in the eaves of houses because when St. Stephen was going to be killed, he hid up in a tree but the wren [give?] gave some sign to his enemies telling them where he was and he was stoned to death, therefore it is said that the wren is a bad bird. It is said that if every egg that the wren (would) lays, if it were broken that it would lay and lay away until it would die.\n", "school_info": "School: Coill-Ch\u00e9im", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Calhame, Co.

Here are some of the birds and the signs of weather they give.When swallows are seen flying low it is a sign of rain, because the insects which are the swallow's food come down when it is going to rain therefore the swallows must come after their food.When two magpies are seen flying together it is a sign of good weather because when it is going to rain one of the pairs stays at the nest and sit on top of it to keep the rain off the eggs or young.Seagulls come inland because they cannot get food during bad weather at sea.There are many stories told about certain birds.The following is an example.When our Lord was nailed to the cross, a little robin came and tried to pick the thorns out of his head. A drop of blood fell on the robin's breast, and it has remained on it ever since.Another story is told of how Saint Colmcille got his name. When Colmcille was being baptised, the woman who was with him forgot his name. The priest asked the baby to be undressed, and when this was done the form of a done was seen on his breast. The priest called him Colmcille which means dove of the church.Written by:- John De Largy.

When the beads were made, Mary was delighted, and fingered them with joy. Then she threaded them on some thick yellow silk.As they took their modest meal together, they spoke of a family that they knew in Egypt. But little did they know that the family were lodging quite near them. Since Mary had seen them the father had died. The mother met Mary next day, and revealed to her, her sorrow. Then she invited Jesus, Mary, and Joseph to come and see her.

The girl attended Mass regularly and after a long space of time she opened the box. She thought it would be full of stones, but to her great surprise there was only one stone in it. From this we conclude that she only heard Mass well once.There is also another story told about a beautiful ship built for millionares.
