He went again to cut the monument and he looked around again and his house was on fire. He went home again, and it was not on fire. The third day he came to cut the monument he said that he would not look round. So he cut the area off the stone, and when he went home his house was burnt to ashes.\n", "school_info": "School: Cluain Fhiadh (C.), Carraig na Si\u00faire", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Clonea, Co.

It happened that a protestant was brought to be interred in the adjoining cemetery. With this, the monks, of course, disagreed, but they were overruled, and the burial took place there. On arising next morning, the monks were surprised to find themselves monastery and cemetery at the opposite side of the river and the protestant's grave alone in the old site.

This graveyard was used for burying the local people. It was supposed to be bewitched and the Kearney's used to find green yarn wound on the hazel bushes in the graveyard and they didn't know what was the cause of it.

An old castle stands about a quarter of a mile from the church and near this castle is a tunnel which leads down to it.

A wealthy lady living in the vicinity died and was buried there, she had a valuable ring on her finger. A man living near by was so desperately hard up for money that he decided to open the newly filled grave and steal the ring. He went at night he himself and an accomplice and they succeeded in unearthing the coffin. The ring proved more difficult than they expected and could not be taken off so the only thing to be done was to cut off the finger. A knife was procured and the finger severed. To their horror the lady in the coffin screamed and sat up. The men thinking it was her ghost ran for their lives. She did not understand what had happened and made her way home to her friends they were all scared to see her and thought it was a ghost. They saw the blood dripping from her fingers but to their astonishment it was'nt a ghost it was the lady herself. She was suffering from stagnation of blood and believed to be dead.

Furthermore, it is believed locally, that the present site of the village of Emly, was the burial-ground of thousands of combatants in the Battle of Monemore, in 1151. The present graveyard is situated on the outskirts of the village. It was formerly a Protestant graveyard, and the steeple of the old church was standing until some 50 years ago.

M.O.H.The ancient cemetery of Moybologue is to be closed by order of Cavan Board of Health. This decision was arrived at at a meeting of the Board on Tuesday, following a report from Dr. O'Reilly, Co. M.O.H. This ancient cemetery, which is situated about three miles from Bailieboro and for miles from Mullagh, is one of the oldest of its kind in Ireland. Within its boundaries are the ruins of an ancient church where tradition avers our National Apostle, St. Patrick, celebrated the Holy Mass, but it is within the realms of possibility that the origin goes back to pre-Christian days. It is in recorded history that about three hundred years before the Christian era the Ard Ri or High King of Erin held a Royal Banquet at Moybologue, and whil the regal feast was in progress an avenging hand of a defeated race swooped down on the royal party and slaughtered them almost to a man. A scion of the royal house, however, succeeded in making his escape, and in after years was restored to the throne as a result of a counter revolution. The historian tells us that as a result of the slaughter of the High King and royal party at Moybologue, the national affairs of the contry took such a turn that for a period of thirty years no Irish military expeditions were sent to foreign countries. It is quite likely that most, if not all of those slaughtered at the royal banquet were buried near to the scene of the carnage and that the present cemetery had its origin in that historic event. An ancient moat stands convenient to the site of the cemetery. For countless generations families from a widely flung area in the counties of Cavan and Meath have been buried in this cemetery, which is the last resting place of distinguished prelates and pastors and other illustrious personages. The closing order will not, however, take effect until a public inquiry is held. And if for sentimental reasons or other causes the people interested do not wish to have the cemetery closed, a way out of the difficulty would be to procure a plat of land adjoining the cemetery and have it added on to the present burial ground. This, however, is a matter for those interested in the continuity of Moybologue as a burial ground, but it seems the only alternative to the complete closing of the cemetery. The matter arose as the Health Board meeting on Thursday out of the following report from the County M.O.H. - \"Moybologue Burial Ground: The Sanitary Inspector and myself inspected the above burial ground on 11th March. The ancient burial ground is something over an acre in size. It is very much overcrowded. In many places the mounds over the graves are raised two feet over the ground. Many of the graves are less than two feet from the surface of the ground. Human bones and pieces of coffins lie on the surface of the cemetery. For the protection of public health, the maintenance of public decency, and to prevent the violation of the respect due to the remains of the deceased persons, application should be made to the Department of Local Government and Public Health to have this burial ground closed to further interments.\" Mr. Farrell said Moybologue was not as bad as Kilann. Dr. O'Reilly, Co. M.O.H. - It is worse. The Chairman said it was time to do away with graveyards that were in such a condition. On the motion of the Chairman it was decided that the necessary representation be made to the Department for the closing of the cemetery.\n", "school_info": "School: Finternagh", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Finternagh, Co.

The church is quadrangular, seperated into sanctuary and nave by a triumphal or choir arch of large dimensions. The nave measures sixty four feet nternally by nineteen feet ten inches. The sanctuary is forty three feet eight inches in length. The choir arch, which is of immense height to the centre, measures eleven feet seven inches at the base. The arch is three feet seven inches in depth. There are two doorways, one on the north and the other on the south of the nave. There is a doorway on the southside of the sanctuary which led from the sacristy. The walls of the church are undiminished, and the whole ruin, although roofless and no longer filled, unless by the numerous dead, is still in a wonderful state of preservation. The eastern or altar window, judging from what remains, must have been gorgeous, and on the western end a bell is still suspended which announces of the parishioners and summons the congregation to worship in the neighbouring Catholic Church. The old bell of Ardcath survived the plunder of the Reformation, tolled away during the penal days, lived to see the Emancipation and only retired from active service a few years ago.\n\n\n\nThe number interred here is very great, as the country adjoining has been very populous and Ardcath, from its Catholic traditions, has been regarded as a cherished resting-place.

One of them is that of a golden gate, believed to have been sent from Rome to the pastor of the church named Father Barragh, hence the locality derived its name. Some peasant who saw the soldiers coming to destroy and lute the church, took away this gate and hid it in a bog near by, and it is believed that while the soldiers were doing this bad work, a great fire fell, and burned of all their hands and arms. The man who hid the gate marked the place where it lay so as to find it when the trouble would be over, but alas! it was never found.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Myshall (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Myshall, Co.

Their intention was to dig for the druids' money. They took with them shovels and spades and many other tools. Having reached the grave one of the men said \"who will dig the first sod\". Anyone was not willing to dig the first sod so they went home and abandoned the idea.In the townland of Ballinatragh there is a Cill that is a burial place of unbaptised children.

This word is not a saint's name. \"F\u00e1n\" here means a slope not \"fanum\" a temple. The name Fanlobus means \"Lupus' Slope.\" The name existed long before the church was built. The country between Kilmoluda and Kilbarry was uncultivated, and F\u00e1nlobus lying between was chosen as a church site for the parish formed by their union. The name \"F\u00e1n\" tells us that the graveyard is situated on a slope. In the graveyard there were two churches, a catholic and a protestant one, a big mould of earth being placed around the protestant one to separate it from the other. The ruins of the protestant church are still to be seen. There are five tombs in the graveyard, on two of which writing can still be seen. One of them was erected in the year 1835.

The wheels were left in the well for two days and two nights and on the morning of the third day the owner of the wheels came to see how they where getting on.to his great surprise however the well had removed about 100 yards below the graves and is in this place at the present day.The owner of the farm was once trying to drain the field where the well was as it was a very marshy place. he worked  at the main drain for one day and when he returned  next morning to complete the work he found that the part of the darin  he had made the day before had bee closed in with large flat stones. seeing this he thought it not wise ti interfere in future with this field and so discontinued the work.He did not like to put his cattle graze in the field then so he decided to plough it up.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: B\u00e1n-T\u00edr (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Banteer, Co.
