They found a weasel's nest with young ones in it at the root of a bush and they flung out the nest along with the stones and roots which were embedded in the ditch.  Shortly afterwards one of the men noticed the two old weasels running towards a can of buttermilk which the men had brought out to the field with them.  The weasels jumped up on the rim of the can, spat into it and then made off as quickly as they came.  After talking the matter over the men decided to put back the nest in its original place.  They restored it as well as they could and placed the young weasels in it.

When the warble is very bad the farmer has to buy a lot of ointment, and put it in on the warble. After some weeks he will buy powder and put it in hot water and poltice the warble. After a few weeks the warble will go away and the horse will be better. All through the year his back will be sore and the farmer will have to pad the straddle for the horse to be able to wear it.

I will always remember that day, for it was, as we sat on the Belloona Bridge, looking over Glenade lake, that we got information that led to our finding the man who was able to explain how the two great rocks came to rest on the lake shore near the bank of the river.  As we sat on the bridge an old farmer came down the road, he stopped to speak to us, or, rather, we got in his way, for we were anxious to hear something about those two unusually large stones that seemed to be put there by some power other than nature.  When we mentioned the matter to the old farmer he was silent for a little, then he said: \"I'm afraid there is no one about here now that could tell you about them rocks except Rory M'Govern up in Lisnabrack; he once lived here in Largy.\"  He left us at that and, as we knew where the townland of Lisnabrack lay, we decided to go the following Sunday night to see Rory.  After a few enquiries along the road, we came to Rory's little thatched house.  On entering we found him sitting by the fire cooking his supper.  We soon mentioned the reason for our visit, and when Rory took the pot from the fire, he lit his pipe, sat back against the wall and started to tell us the following story which, indeed, explains the presence of the two peculiar stones embedded in the shore of Glenad lawe:--\"Jimmie M'Cadden of Ballyglass, was a young man who was fond of keeping a good greyhound.  One day he decided on going to Largy mountain for a hunt, and on his way he put a hare on the Bar of glebe and the dog and hare disappeared into a fort in Tully, in a place called Bradogue, Jimmie went into the for to try and find his dog, but as it was a very warm day fatigue overcame Jimmie in his search, he lay down and soon was fast asleep.\"  Like most young fellows Jimmie had often pictured himself a married man with a pretty girl for his wife; how as he awoke from his slumber in the fort he saw a beautiful girl approach him and he rubbed his eyes for he did not think such a lovely firl existed, in fact he felt and must have looked nervous, for the girl said: \"Well, Jimmie, why fearest thou a maid like me, haven't you been planning to marry a good-looking girl?  What do you think about me, or do I come up to our expectation?\"  \"Glory be to God,\" said Jimmie, \"your the finest looking girl I ever set eyes on.\"  \"Well,\" said the girl, \"if I marry you now you will have to make three promises, and, remember Jimmie, three promises you must keep, or if not it will be ill for you.\"  Jimmie immediately agreed to promise anything, and asked her to name what she required.  The maiden said--\"Well, here they are: (1) you can never go home until I have some one to talk to me in your absence; (2) you will never think of any other girl while I live, and (3) you will never go out and come back again to the house without bringing something to leave on the fire.\"  Jimmie swore to keep all three promises and they were married next day.  Jimmie's wife was a very wealthy lady with land and cattle; so their marriage proved very happy for some years.  At the end of seven years' married life Jimmie's wife said: \"Jimmie, it is time you went home to see your father and mother\"  (Jimmie had three sons now) \"take two of the best horses in the stable and go, but be sure to keep your promises while you are away.\"  So Jimmie started for home to see the old people.  Now, in the old days, Jimmie was fond of a firl at home (she was a daughter of Andy the Spriggers), and as he climbed the hill to Ballyglass who should he meet coming down to Lurganboy but his old girlfriend.  Well, who could blame the poor fellow to kiss the girl after seven years' absence, and her he did, and the promise he had made about girls never crossed his mind at the time, but the following night as he sat between his father and mother at the fire the thought struck him that he had broken one of the promises made seven years ago to his wife.  As his father's house was beside Keegan's wood there was a fine fire of beech on the hearth, but it was not able to cheer up poor Jimmie that night, and the next morning at break of day he started home to his wife.  As he approached the house he thought it strange that neither his wife nor sons were out to meet him; they always met him with a welcome even if he were away for only one day.  Jimmie jumped down from his horse and rushed into the house (forgetting to take something for the girl) to find his wife sitting by the fire in a very downcast mood.  He asked if she were sick or what was wrong.  She answered saying; \"There is a great deal wrong now, Jimmie' you have broken two of your promises and I must leave you\".  Poor Jimmie tried to explain but it was no use, off went herself and her three sons in the direction of Glenade lake with Jimmie following begging  her to come back, and that he would be faithful to his promises in future, but it was all of no avail.  He saw his wife and sons disappear into the lake, and to make things worse all their cattle, sheep, and horses followed them to the bottom of the lake, only Jimmie's dog remaining.  Jimmie spent all that day crying by the lake shore not knowing what to do.  Then a plan formed in his mind, if he could get help to drain the lake he would surely find his family again.  So early next morning he asked the young men of the neighbourhood to come and help him make a canal out of the lake.  \"I was one of the lads who went to help Jimmie,\" said Rory M'Govern, \"and didn't we get on well with the work when by dinner tine the lake had gone down so much that we could see the chimneys of what appeared to be a great castle in the centre of the lake.  Then as we stood watching the water flow away with Jimmie in great spirits in the sure hope of finding his wife again, a whistle sounded on Largy Rock and it was answered by another in Pullahiagha, and the next instant there came two huge rocks flying through the air, one from the direction of each whistle, they met with a bang over Balloona Bridge and fell into the canal we had just made.  No human power could ever hope to move these huge boulders.  The lake quickly filled up to its old level, and Jimmie's hopes were gone forever.  \"For the remaining five or six years of his life,\" concluded Rory, \"Jimmie M'Cadden might be met on the Glebe-Largy road on is Brian Bawn's wood gazing down at the lake, for he never went back to Ballyglass.  The only little pastime he had was when he went out with his dog for a race on the Largy mountain.  The dog he had at the end of his days was a direct descendant of Fido--the one that led Jimmie to meet his wife--and, strange to say, this young dog always avoided in an 'uncanny' way the Bradogue Fort.\"\n\n\n\nIntelligent, hard-headed, and practical, the North Leitrim people are in all their ordinary dealings. They are also a jovial, quick-witted people who at all times, or nearly so, give the impression that questions concerning what might be termed the occult do not give them serious thought. And yet, when conversation is turned in that direction a serious thoughtfulness is at once apparent and the listener may be told of happenings which go to show that old beliefs still linger in the minds of the people. Here is a story I recently heard of the \"taking\" of butter from a neighbour's churn. The tale was told to me by a man who had it told directly to him by the woman concerned. His method of narration gave me to understand that he was not sceptical. \"This was an intelligent woman\" he said, \"and above the ordinary.\" I don't believe much in superstition but I could not disregard the story she told me. She had five cows and for a number of years was getting no butter for her churning. One particular morning in June herself and her husband were churning away and after being at it for a considerable time were on the point of giving it up when an old \"travelling woman\" came in and sat down at the fire and started to smoke her pipe. She heard the people of the house complaining and heard the woman say \"we will throw it to the calves there is no use working at it any longer.\" On hearing this the old \"travelling woman\" asked what was wrong and was told  \"someone was taking the butter.\" The old woman asked if they had any suspicions of any particular neighbour, and was told that a neighbour with a small number of cows was suspected, and that the neighbour with few cows had always a very big supply of butter. On hearing this the \"old crony\" of a travelling woman remarked to the woman of the house: \"There is only one cure for you. Go into that woman's byre and bring a porringer with you. Go at night and draw milk from each of her cows. Bring it home and put it in your churn and your butter will come back.\" The \"woman of the house\" had a feeling that to do as she had been advised by the old woman of the roads would be an admission of her belief in superstition and contrary to her religious beliefs. To my narrator she said: \"It was the hardest thing I was ever asked to do, but through desperation, I consented.\"  From that day she had a normal supply of butter from her cows. The next time the suspected neighbour went to churn she found she had a very small return and she went at once into the other woman's house for the loan of salt but she did not get it.To have loaned the salt would have broken the cure. It is not lucky to lend salt.\" The above story is implicitly believed in the locality where it is told. Another I heard also concerns the \"power\" of certain people to \"take\" their neighbours property. It was told to me in this wise:-\"Roshie was thirty years in bed and was supposed to be a witch. She could take money from your house by wishing it, or meal from your chest. She could do that from her bed. Before she took to the bed she used to stand on a hill on a May morning before the people were up and watch for the earliest smoke. The houses with the early smoke, she said, were the houses of the most industrious people. As she saw smoke curling from the chimneys she said:-\"From the houses I see smoke in all the butter to me.\" Her wish or command always succeeded and her own house was always full of butter. One morning the priest, returning from a sick call, was sheltering behind a bush from heavy rain. He heard Roshie say:- \"The butter from these houses to me.\" The priest, in a joke said \"half of it to me.\" When he got home he found his house filled up with butter.\n", "school_info": "School: Killasnett", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Curraghfore, Co.

Then going to the field of the people whose butter is to be charmed, throw an old spancel across the gap.When the Butter has been charmed, the following is the method of getting it back. The person from whom it has been stolen, must get something belonging to a plough, then he must redden it, and bring it out and leave it in the churn in the dairy. This has the power to bring in the person who is charming away the Butter. When he or she comes in and asks for something, on no account must it be given, for if it is given the charm will not work, and is said to be broken for that time.\n", "school_info": "School: Cor na Gaoithe", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Cornageeha, Co.

He would hammer the piece of iron into it so that the nail wold be formed. Then the nail would be as tight as if it were welded into it. Then he would loosen a nut and the nail would fall out made and all. This man's was name was Pat McGrale and he had a son named James. Pat died about 1870. James started this game too, but he did not follow it up. This kind of nails was made before the new make of nails was available.\n\n\n\nA good few years ago, before any threshing mills were in the country a lot of people made flales for the purpose of threshing their corn. I have heard specially of a man who used to make flales for sail.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Mohill (2)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Mohill, Co.

He set the dogs after her thinking it was a natural hare. The hare made for the mountains and made for a little hut. When the hare was going in the door of the hut the dogs caught her by the leg, but she escaped. When the man went into the hut there was an old hag inside and her leg all torn. This old hag was the hare who was milking the cows. She told the man that once she was a beautiful queen and that one of Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann wanted to marry her but she wouldn't.

When the people are driving horses you can hear them say \"go on out of that\" or sometimes \"gee up\". The stable, in which horses are kept, is just an ordinary outhouse, with a well-bedded floor and a crib made of boards nailed in front of the wall for the hay to be put in. The fodder they get consists of hay, and corn is given twice a day when working. Horses are shod by nailing a horse-shoe, made of either iron or rubber, to each foot. They are clipped by a  machine made for the purpose. The back and upper portion of the neck towards the mane are never cut. This is done to keep the animal warm during cold weather. Some people can test eggs  with a needle and cork, and they are able to tell whether they will yield roosters or pullets. If eggs are not laid before twelve o'clock, most likely they will produce cocks when hatched. Most people put an \"x\" on each egg so that if any other hen lays alongside them they will know the difference in the eggs.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Fortview, Clones", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Clones, Co.

One day a neighbour's child came to the house to ask me to go to see her mother who was sick in bed. I went and when I went in the woman's husband was just taking the butter from a churn that he was after making. He was ashamed when he saw me - not being a man's job. I took the butter from the churn and was as careful about it as I would of my own.The woman of the house was very ignorant and was jealous of me. After that day I noticed that my own quantity of butter became less. I was going to market one day with my husband and we met that woman on the Courthouse Bridge. She then told me that another neighbouring woman had twice as much butter as she used to have. She meant of course that that woman took the butter from me. I believe that she was lying and that it was herself who took it, by her evil wishes.After five or six years I had the usual amount of butter.\n", "school_info": "School: Kenmare (B.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Kenmare, Co.

He is shod by a blacksmith. They are clipped in the Spring. This is done by a clipping machine. It is usually done by the farmer himself.\n\n\n\nThese are the farm and domestic animals, the horse, cow,\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Ballybay (Hall St.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ballybay, Co.

Mark the egg with a purple pencil so that you will know if another hen lays in the nest.When putting down eggs put a horseshoe along with them for luck. If you break an egg to see if the chicken is, if the hen sees you when it comes out she will pick it and kill it. When there is a kind of ring on the shell there is no chicken in it.

She lived very near my grandfather in the parish of Kilglass. She had six cows, and she could never get any butter. This day she began to churn as she had done many times before. But  had she been there since she could not get the  butter. After working at it for hours she gave it up as a bad job.One day she was all alone and an old beggar-woman, as she thought came in to her. She told the tale of woe to the old woman.

This method of turning was called plebbing; the scraw where the furrow was to be was cut in lengths and put on the ridge and allowed to dry: these scraws were called fodeens.  When fully dry they were gathered and small fires were lighted at convenient distances and the fodeens placed round & on the fires and allowed to burn thoroughly.

The wool that was used was shorn from the sheep, and was thoroughly washed and dried.  Then it was taken to the mill.  The wool was made into rolls by cards or carders.The spinning was done by placing between the palm of the hand and the knee, the end of one of the wool rolls, which is gradually pulled with a twister..

A baran was chiefly composed of a goat skin and wooden rim.  The skin was removed from the goat, care being taken that the skin wall not become holed by the knife that removed it.The skin being removed was spread on the ground with the outside upwards, and was covered over with slackened lime. It was then buried in clay for about ten or fourteen days according to the weather temperature.When removed from the clay, it was placed on a stand and the hair was removed. It came off easily.

A good reaper only made two halves of a sheaf.  (That may require explanation.  The number of ears of corn which the reaper took in his hand for each draw of the hook, was a \"thaw\" (Tait).  Having cut the thaw, he seized a fresh thaw and cut again, without releasing the first, and carried on thus until he carried sufficient thaws in his hand to make half a sheaf.  They were then put down, and a new start made.   Thus there were but two halves made of the sheaf).  There were some tip-top reapers in Croom. Slobber was one of the best of them.Half an Irish acre was good work for a plough-man and pair of horses.  That would be ban.  Why would a man cut more corn (with a scythe) than hay in a day? Because he would have to cut \"out\" the hay and the corn was cut \"in\".

There once lived an old woman. She was a witch, and she lived in a small house in the fields.  A farmer lived near her.  He had the finest \"bawn\" of cows you could lay your eyes on.  They had a lot of milk, but when the farmer and his boy would go to milk them, they were milked.  One night, he stopped up, to see who was milking the cows.  About five o'clock he looked towards the cows.  There was a rabbit milking one of the cows.  The rabbit saw the farmer, and she ran towards the little house.  He set his dogs at her.

Molly bought this donkey from a gentleman named John Geyer, who lived in Anough.  The donkey, it is said, took his stand in Noah's ark the same time as Barney's bull.Now Molly had a beautiful little trap and harness, which she bought at an auction, and she spent the summer of 1936 touring the County Limerick, accompanied by one Mrs. Beatty, whose maiden name was Molly McCarthy from Patrickswell\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Tobar P\u00e1draig", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Patrickswell, Co.

The owners raised the stone themselves and some of them had to employ labourers at 2d a day to assist them. The stones were piled in heaps at the quarries and sold at 1/ a load to people who needed it.There was a lime kiln on every farm around here - even on a five acre farm. The lime was burned principally for top dressing and it was mixed with bog stuff and stuff taken out of drains. The heap was mixed in early winter and put out on the land in Spring and Mr John Kiernan told me that the old people believed that there was no manure any good without a mixture of lime. Of all these kilns and quarries there is only one kiln in Mullinroe that burns lime now but there is scarcely a farm in the district but has a field called \"the Lime Kiln field\" although in most cases there is no trace of the old kiln.

As fruit is very plentiful this present year the children go to the woods and gather nuts, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries.  The boys make snares and go to hunt with dogs.  The older people organize an excursion and they go to some other town or county.                       The outdoor games that are played by the young women are; tennis, hockey and camogie.

Parties make agreements by sticking each others hands. Animals are usually marked when sold with a raddle.\n\n\n\nThere were not as many shops in olden days as at present. People would go to the nearest town. Some people would do all the shopping on Sunday after mass. Nowadays as there are so many shops and conveniences of shopping that there is no need of Sunday shopping. Clothing and groceries were mostly sold. Any one that had money to buy them would give it. Some people would get goods and then work in exchange as payment, I do not know of any of theses words being used.\n", "school_info": "School: Clonmellon (B.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Clonmellon, Co.

They were generally sown on lea land and manured with sea weed (or \"woar\" as it is locally called) or well rotted farm yard manure. The crop being of the Leguminous family and capable of extracting free nitrogen from the air was a valuable crop to sow as a forerunner to wheat. Beekeepers valued it highly as the blossoms were rich in nector for honey making purposes. The beans were cut when ripe and bound into bundles with straw latches. They were put in stacks to save. They were easily saved as they dried quickly. When dry they were threshed with a flail and put into bags.In earlier times Wexford beans were exported to the West Indies. Beans were ground into meal which was excellent food for pigs fowl and for \"finishing off\" horses. A well known Veterinary Surgeon (in Wexford Mr B. Hickey) uses beans regularly for \"finishing off\" his horses.Bean stalks were used for firing especially for putting on the lids of the bake pots to bake bread.SEA WEED (or woar)  AS MANURE\"Woar\" is used extensively as a manure in this parish and it is said that on account of large quantities of this valuable natural manure being available merely for the trouble of gathering and drawing it, the valuation of the farms is very high and rents were higher than elsewhere.It is used chiefly for root crops such as mangolds, turnips and potatoes\n", "school_info": "School: Danescastle", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Danescastle, Co.

Nearly every farmer produced a field of them.  They were grown up to thirty or twenty five years ago and I can always remember the magnificent perfume of a field of beans which grew opposite the farmhouse gate above.  I believe that even still a farmer or two in Co Wexford -about Drinagh - still grow them.  They are generally sown on lea land and manured with sea weed or short well rotted manure.  The crop being a \"legumenosae\" was particularly useful to the land and succeeding crop of wheat was usually most productive - in yield + quality.Furlongs who lived where Paddy Roche of Verneglye now lives where the last people to grow them in this district.  They were very often grown for the sake of bees as being of the clover family they were rich in nectar.They were cut down when ripe and each man took out with him a bundle of straw latches with which to bind the bundle of beans.  The bundles were put in stacks to save.  They were readily saved as even after a heavy night's rain they dried quickly.  They were threshed with a flail and the beans put up in sacks and sometimes sold.In earlier times Wexford beans were exported even to the West Indies.  The beans kept for home use were ground and the meal was a splendid food for pigs, cows + fowl.  The meal is specially useful for finishing off horses in training and Mr Barthy Hickey, Wexford always uses it to give a finish to his animals.  The stalks were used for firing being specially useful for putting on lids when bread was baked in bake pots.\n", "school_info": "School: Cuan an Bhainigh (Bannow)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Carrick, Co.

Her husband used to take all the neighbours butter to the Dublin market.  This was before there were any railways so it was by car they made the journey.  One night her husband sent her back with a butter-cool to one of the farmer's who lived a long way off.  She decided to cross the fields for a short cut.  After walking for a long time she wondered she wasn't near the house.  Darkness was falling so she stood and looked all round her only to find she was back in the field where she started.  She sat down exhausted from the walking and from the weight of the cool.  When she had rested she saw a light a short distance from her so not knowing what else to do she started for it but she seemed to get no nearer till finally it dissppeared. Quite worn out from tramping she laid down the cool and sat down on it resolved to stay there till morning dawned.  She had not sat there however when she remembered the old custom of turning your coat when you are led away by the fairies.  No sooner has she hers turned when she knew where she was.  She got up and started for home but it was a long time till she forgot her adventures with the Daoine maire.10th February 1938Lilly Redmond,Tara HillGorey.\n", "school_info": "School: Tara Hill", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Kilcavan, Co.

If he builds his byre on cross ridges he would have no luck with the cows or if he builds it on a list or near a liss he would not have luck with the cows.   Some people cut crosses and hang holly on the stall where Christmas comes.  They also hang palm on the stall.  Cows are a lot cleverer that men in many ways.  They know the change of weather better than any man.This is a story I heard:-There was a man living in Kilgobnet and he was building his stall, but he could get no suitable flag to put over the door.  There was a flag in a loss near the place and he took it and put it over the door.  When the stall was finished he put fourteen cows into it, but when he got up the following morning one cow was missing.  The same thing happened for seven nights.  He met an old man one day and told him his story.  The man looked at the stall and he asked him where he got the flag.  He told him so the old man said to put it back.  He did as he was told and the following morning one of his cows was returned.  This happened for seven nights until all his cattle were restored.There was another man living in Clondrohid.

This was also done for luck with the cows in milking and calving.  Then on the night before May Day all doors are locked and barred and holy water is sprinkled on the cows for fear of any evil person coming and milking the cows unknown to the owner.  It was also believed that hares and other wild animals could also milk the cows.If a calf died belonging to any person he would feel very worried about the burying of the calf.  If at all possible it would not be buried in his own land as it was believed that would bring more sickness on his cattle.  The calf was usually shifted away to some other man's land and buried there in some bog to soft place as quickly as possible.

This was made of sheep or goats skin fastened to a sally stick in the form of a circle. The corn could not be winnowed except on a dry and windy day. The person that ued to hold the bouran of oats should stand upon a chair and leave the oats drop down and then the wind would blow away the chaff; and if the oats were dirty it should be winnowed a couple of times.

Often the dwelling house had to be the dwelling of all his stock. (This accounts for the custom in Ireland of having to manure before the house). The out offices if any were small. The food was of the simplest kind, for if the landlord discovered that a tenant had butter at breakfast or meat at dinner, even on Sunday his rent was to be raised. Any monies received by a struggling farmer from abroad of which information was received by the landlord, was to the detriment of such farmer.

He hung it in the cow stall and strange to say the cows had a wonderful quantity of milk that evening. Next morning there was a big increase in the milk too.This worried the boy and he went to Confession and told the priest about the increased milk the cows had. The priest asked him whether he got anything lost and the boy told him about the spancel. \"Well, said the priest, put it back where you found it because that was put in the river to injure somebody but not you\"The boy returned home and carried out the priests instructions.
