There was an old woman living not far away who had the cure of warts.  The person who had the warts went to this woman to get the cure made.When she came as far as the house where the wart curer lived the person with the warts had a conversation with the wart owner.  Then she told the person with the warts to get a ball of yarn for her.When she had that done the old woman told her to kneel down and the old woman knelt down also.  (Then the old woman knelt down also.)Then she took the ball of yarn from the person with the warts and rubbed it on the warts and she prayed over the warts.  The prayers which she said were ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys in Irish to Saint Molua.She then told the person to bury the ball of yarn in the manure heap.  She also told her that when the ball of yarn would be rotten the warts would be all gone.

The eldest member - John - was the most athletic of the brothers. About 70 years ago, the Dunleas had a farm in Glanmire, as well as the one in Ardnageehy, and from the farm in Glanmire they sent milk to Cork in large churns. One of the feats of John Dunlea was to jump from the ground into the churn and out again. His brother Batt - often tried to perform this feat, but though he was able to get into the churn - he was not able to jump out.    On the Watergrasshill - Glenville road is the entrance to the Dunlea farm yard and opposite this is another gateway. Another feat of John Dunlea's was to jump from one pier to another of this gateway.    Another feat of his was to vault over the half-door from the kitchen to the yard. This required considerable skill as the door is somewhat low, and John Dunlea was a very tall man.   Across the kitchen there is a large heavy beam from wall to wall - used for hanging bacon etc, and Bridget Dunlea often told how she saw her brothers contesting as to who could perform the best somersault over this beam.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Cnoc na Biolaraighe", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Watergrasshill, Co.
