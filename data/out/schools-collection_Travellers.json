They used to stay for about a week in one village. The people had great respect for them. They gave them the best bed they had and whatever they liked was given to tramps. If they were refused they told in other districts how they were ill treated. When a tramp or beggar entered a village the people came to the house where he was staying and welcomed him. In the evening they gathered into the house and listened to his stories. It was from him they learned what was happening outside their own parish.

He usually got a plate of stirabout for his supper. When they wanted to make him leave they would not prepare his supper until very late in the night. They would make the people leave early in the night and they would rake the fire.

The men make vessels from tin such as cans, strainers, basins and saucepans.  The men also repair cans etc. and each man has his tools in a wooden box called a budget on his back.  The tinkers attend fairs and markets in ordered to sell their tins and to enjoy a good day.  The men were often seen drunk in the evening and they fell out and fought among themselves.

They prayed that the donor and relatives would be blessed that they ought enjoy good health and that the donor might be rewarded many fold for any little \"charity\" that might be given - a few potatoes, a handful of meal, flour, etc. Such people were called poor people but children used to call them \"beggars\". These were satisfied if they could get enough to supply their little wants and if they could get a night's shelter. When these came to the district they stayed in some particular house which they made their headquarters and from this house they set out each day to seek alms and they returned to that house each evening. Everyone pitied these and gave them some little alms. They slept in the kitchen or in a barn and as compensation for the shelter and comfort they gave their gathering of flour, potatoes etc to the householder. As  these travelled a good deal they had many stories and some of these were related to the people of the house.

They travel in groups usually or clan by the same name. They camp by the roadside or in a disused house. The men work away by day making and mending tin cans and buckets, kettles etc. while the women folk take them around to the farmers houses to sell them.

The ordinary tramp tries to live by seeking food or money from door to door, from cottiers and farmers in country districts but generally avoids towns or villages as much as possible, fearing the law of the land which forbids begging. Many tramps have special houses in country districts, where they are allowed refuge at night, and can have free meals, but such are familiar to the farmers who befriend them and they make themselves sociable by telling stories to the farmers' children, relating their wandering exploits and detailing the merits and demerits of neighbouring farmers.

When the harvest was gathered in, the people had feasting and merry-making in the barns.  This lasted that whole week and geese were killed and eaten at the feast.Written byMary B. KellyMonktownBrownstownNavanGiven by:-James Reynolds, Follistown,Brownstown,Navan(Farm labourer)20 November 1938\n\n\n\nA real old family of the name of Keane used to come around here about 40 or 50 years ago. They were a kind of \"little dealers\".  They'd sell pins and needles and thread. They'd stay a night in nearly every place. They were put up in the barn. A big old metal pot was got and a few lumps of turf or coal were put into it. Them when they reached the barn with the pot, more turf or coal were put into it. Before long the pot would give out a great heat for it would all get red. Then all the neighbours gathered in to hear the news. They'd sit round the pot in a circle and enjoy the news and stories. They'd sit on straw and bits of planks. This would pass the night grand.\n", "school_info": "School: Walterstown", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Walterstown, Co.

They used visit this district three or four times a year. Some of the family used go providing for themselves But the whole family used visit the district for the \"big fair day\" which was held on the 25th of September and is still held.On that day they would sell the tin buckets and dishes cheaper than the shopkeepers. When the fair was over they had plenty money and would go into some public house and drink plenty of beer and whiskey.This family is scattered all over country now and never visits this district.There are a few of these travellers going around the country always, and they sell pens, pencils, tie-pins, pipes, holy-pictures, little articles of ware, camphor, and a lot of other little articles.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Drom Dh\u00e1 Liag (B.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Drimoleague, Co.
