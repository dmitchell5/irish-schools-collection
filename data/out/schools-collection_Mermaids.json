She did not see him and he gave a good look at the comb with which she combed her hair. The comb was a lot different to what the people of the place used. It was made of strong fish ribs. He then made a drive at the mermaid and carried her cap[?]. Just as he was about to turn away she caught him, but he would not give her the cap unless she married him. At last she consented and they both got married but still he would not give her the cap. After a while they had two young sons, but still he would not give her the cap. He got afraid she might find the cap and that she would leave him so he decided to hide it in some place that she could not find it. After about twenty years she found the cap by one of her young sons and he gave it to her. She then changed the two sons into fish and then she threw the two fish into the sea and they disappeared.

Many men had tried to take the shawl but had always failed because they had not gone about it in the right way. The most important thing that was missing was a horse. That horse should be, the third thorough-bred mare in descent of the first thorough-bred mare in the island. A man by the name of Shea got the horse, when he neared the rock he got off her, and stole towards the mermaid. He seized the shawl and was returning with it on his horse, when a mighty wave came in and broke her back. The island was freed from the enchantment but a terrible plague came over his tribe.
