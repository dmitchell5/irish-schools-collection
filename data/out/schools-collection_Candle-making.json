The candle was then left aside to get hard. Lines of them were often hung from the rafters on the ceiling. Mrs Carroll, Grogan, was known to make rush lights, which were the candles of those days about 1870. The rushlights were made by bringing in rushes, peeling them and dipping them in melted fat. In the district of Rathdowney long ago, families used to make their own candles by melting suet, leaving it to set for half an hour, and then rolling it into the shape of a candle, a piece of wick was put through the centre of the candle, this was commonly known as dip candle. Mrs Fogarty who resided in Tullavolty made candles by mixing beef of the sheep and fat beef together. Rushes were dipped in this grease and twisted. An ink bottle served as a candle stick.\n", "school_info": "School: St John of God Convent, Rathdowney", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rathdowney, Co.

The centre was then immersed in melted fat or grease. This grease was made by heating butter, lard or fat. When the grease had penetrated through the rush it was taken out and left to dry. When it was dry it was ready for use.       There was a special candle-stick made from lead for this type of candle. It had a long narrow stem, which was hallow in the centre.

At that time (50 years ago) people used very little meat of any kind. It was an unknown thing for people to be sufficiently well off to kill a pig for the household. The people were very poor - desperately badly off owing to the exorbitant rents they had to pay to the landlords.    When a cow got too old to be of any further use and in an unsaleable condition she was killed for human consumption and cured. Sometimes the beef was boiled in a pot of porridge and eaten with the porridge.     The tallow in the cow was preserved and made into candles. There was a woman living near us named Abbey Moynihan who possessed a mould. When a cow was killed the owner of the animal sent for the mould. I remember it well. It was a large brass affair shaped like a candle. There was a place for inserting the wick - 3 or 4 cotton threads. The tallow was melted and poured in and left to set and harden. When hard it was taken out.   These candles were very unsatisfactory. In the first place they gave only a very poor light.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: An B\u00f3thar Bu\u00ed (B.), \u00c1th Treasna", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Boherboy, Co.

About fifty years ago the people made their own candles. They made them of fat which they got from sheep and goats. First they got a pot and boiled the fat in it. While the fat would be boiling they would set the moulds and prepare the wick. They used put twelve moulds into an iron stand and put in a piece of twisted cotton into the middle of the moulds.

A quantity of home - cured lard was melted in a sort of pot called a grisset. In this, the peeled rushes were dipped one by one, and left aside to dry, and firm, and when firm were ready for use. One of these candles burned about ten or fifteen minutes and that being so there was always a large supply kept in every house.There was a special candle stick called a sconce, made for holding them, quite a different type from that of the present day. The sconce consisted of a square block of wood which rested on the floor and into which a small upright post somewhat thicker than a shovel shaft was mortised. The post was about four feet high with an iron clip in the top for holding the candle. Weavers and others who required good light kept several candles burning at the same time.With the progress of time rush candles were superseeded  by paraffin oil and wax candles, and now in turn paraffin and wax are being superseded by electricity.\n", "school_info": "School: Corlis", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Corlis, Co.

The rushes were gathered by the banks of Rivers and three parts of them removed leaving a small strip to support the pith. They were thoroughly dried in the sun. Then they were drawn through a vessel called the grisset (which was a long shaped vessel with pointed ends) of boiling tallow or grease and then hung on lines to dry. The holder in which those lights were burned was usually a home-made wooden stand. About 2 1/2 feet high the top end of which was like the present day candlestick for the tallow dips. About 6 ins (?) down from the top was a pliers like affair for holding the rush.
