Shoe making is his only occupation. The people would not break a branch from the tree under which he works as some misfortune would befall them if they did so. It is said that if a person was able to catch the lepreachan and not let him go until he tells where a crock of gold is hidden, be would get one from him. The lepreachan has a cat protecting each pot of gold so that people are afraid to dig for it. Years ago a man named Johny Tierney caught a leipreachan and got a crock of gold from him on condition that he never would interfere with the leipreachan's residence. Johny agreed with the Leipreachan but when he went home he discovered that it was withered leaves that were in the pot instead of gold. It is said that a leipreachan keeps house for the fairies and repairs shoes for them. A leipreachan is only the size of a man's hand. There is one old fairy fort situated in the townland of Loughross. It is guarded by brushes and is of a round shape.
