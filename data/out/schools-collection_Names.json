A neighbour, who was going into Letterkenny one day, when Wallace's Foundry was started making \"metal heads\" for ploughs, was asked where he was going. He replied: \"I am going to get my \"iron head\" off and a \"metal head\" on. His descendants still get \"iron head\".\"The Cats\". Over 100 years ago a man in this district went to the Fair in Milford and brought a cow. When asked if she had much milk, he said she hadn't as much milk as a \"furrow\" cat\". His grandchildren and great grandchildren are known locally as the \"cats\".(b) Personal - \"The King\". One time a man here, when somewhat under the influence of whiskey (his name was Gibbons) said that \"there were a lot of Gibbons from Ramelton to Churchhill but he was King of them\". He is still called \"the King\".\"The Bishop\". This was given to a man when coming from Church one Sunday as he was swaggering along with a silk hat in his hand. Kate Elliott, an old woman, saw him coming along in this way and said: \"There he comes 'swagger' like the Bishop\". This man was known as the \"Bishop\" till the day of his death at 70 years of age - name given at age of 20 years.\n", "school_info": "School: Ednacarnon", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Edenacarnan South, Co.
