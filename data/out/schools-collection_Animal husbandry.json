It used to be a custom of the old people to drive two, if they had more than two cows, if in first because it was said if the third touched the other two going into the cow house or byre they would give no milk.There was a remedy for that, if a neighbour came along and put a sheep's foot in the byre without your knowledge.  The first time you would remark this foot you could drive the cows in way at all you liked because one of them would not be able to take the milk off the other.Our cow house was newly repaired but the old was just a plain mortar floor and a very deep group.  But this one is boarded and cement in some places and a nice small group in it.

When the people are driving horses you can hear them say \"go on out of that\" or sometimes \"gee up\". The stable, in which horses are kept, is just an ordinary outhouse, with a well-bedded floor and a crib made of boards nailed in front of the wall for the hay to be put in. The fodder they get consists of hay, and corn is given twice a day when working. Horses are shod by nailing a horse-shoe, made of either iron or rubber, to each foot. They are clipped by a  machine made for the purpose. The back and upper portion of the neck towards the mane are never cut. This is done to keep the animal warm during cold weather. Some people can test eggs  with a needle and cork, and they are able to tell whether they will yield roosters or pullets. If eggs are not laid before twelve o'clock, most likely they will produce cocks when hatched. Most people put an \"x\" on each egg so that if any other hen lays alongside them they will know the difference in the eggs.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Fortview, Clones", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Clones, Co.

The donkey is the largest of the farm animals.\n\n\n\nThere is a story connected with milking. When a cow is bought in the fair the luckpenny is placed in the bottom of the milking bucket and the cow after calving is milked on the luck penny for three or four times.

Some farmers keep young cows and fairly big calves which are called yearlings and a few bullocks. Some farmers keep young calves. The horse is the most important animal on the farm. In summer the horse is left out in the field. When he is working hard he is given hay.In winter the horse is in the stable. he is given hay, oats and turnips. When he is in a stable it is necessary that he gets water. In winter the cow is given pulp hay turnips or potatoes. She is kept in a cow house. Some cow houses are cemented some are not.Holy water which is blessed at Easter and that which is blessed is usually sprinkled on the cow house.

If a cow is inclined to kick while milking it is usual to tie her legs.  The ties are not homemade.It is an old custom that on May Eve we hang a May bush over the cowhouse door so as to bring luck on the stock, another custom is to put the sign of the cross on the cow's hip after milking.  It is put on with the froth of the milk.  When calling hens we say \"Tuk Tuk\".  We never set the eggs of a young goose because there is some superstition about setting them.

The poultry consists of hens, ducks, and geese. All cows have got names in farms which are comparatively small but where the number of cows is large, numbers are used instead. Some of the names of the cows at home are \"The Dexter\" \"The Big Blue\" \"The Blue Heifer\", \"Barry\" and \"Cocked Horns\". When being driven, cows are ordered to \"how, how\", and when being called are addressed enticingly, \"sub, sub, sub.\"There are two types of cow-houses, the large kind accommodating one row of cows, and the double kind housing two rows.

All farmers possess horse, the number varying with the area of land under tillage. Mr Mc Dowell of Marsh Farm, who tills upwards of sixty acres, often has as may as a dozen horses in his stables, while the owners of small farms, till from five to ten acres, find ample work for at least a pair. The breeds most in favour are the Clydesdale and the Shire with a slight preference for the former. Blooded horses are scarce neither thoroughbred nor hunter being bred in the district but Captain Holmes, Dellin, and Mr Michael Mc Ardle, Miltowngrange, the well known amateur rider keep some fine specimens of hunters - purchased ones.All farm horses here are \"let out on grass\" from 1st May till middle of October and receive no additional food during that period. When taken in for the Winter they are generally clipped \"trace high\". This is done either by the owner with a hand-clipper or by the local blacksmith, Patrick Murtagh, who with a wheel-propelled machine does the work much more quickly and effectively at the reasonable rate of 2/6 per animal. The idea in clipping is to preven excessive sweating during the heavy-work in Winter ploughing and to make grooming more easy. This matter of grooming is considered of great importance a \"curry\" comb and dander brush being employed in the operation which is performed in the morning before work begins and in the evening on returning to the stables.[Drawing] - Curry Comb[Drawing] - Dander Brush\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Dromiskin (B.), Dundalk", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Dromiskin, Co.

When horses come in after work, they are nearly always perspiring and if put out in the fields in this state, they are liable to catch colds as cold winds blow in Autumn. In the mornings in Winter, horses get half a bucket of oats mixed with 2 large handfuls of bran each. When this is finished they get a like full of hay each. They are then taken out to work.

The size of the stall depends upon the number of cattle it is required to house.   In some stalls cows are tied, with a chain around their necks fixed to the wall, others are tied with a rope around their horns and in the best equipped stalls they are tied with two sticks or standards connected with an iron loop, the latter being the safest.   Horses are housed in stables specially built and are fed in a place called a manger. The food which is generally given to horses is oats, hay, mangolds, and furze - their staple food being hay and oats. Horses are shod with iron and rubber shoes.    Rubber shoes are used of late as the surface of some roads after being tarred is slippery. Any ordinary man can put on rubber shoes but it takes a smith to make and put on iron shoes.

Long ago by the power of the devil some women, tied a spancel to a bridge or to where two rivers meet, on May morning, to get the butter of the neighbourhood.The month of March is the chief month for hatching.  Each hen hatches twelve of her own eggs.  Hens hatch for three weeks, and geese, ducks and turkeys a month each.  Some people are very superstitions about hatching eggs.  It is mislucky to give a hatching, hen.  Some jealous people for fear the birds would come out, put a pin hole, or wash the eggs, when giving them away.\n\n\n\nThe cow-house is called the stall, In each stall there are two sticks standing\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: R\u00e9idhle\u00e1n (Measctha), \u00c1th an Ch\u00f3iste", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rylane, Co.

Two long planks each the length of the house are at each end of the house and out of these are ropes from which the cows are tied by the neck. In former times tyings were made of hair. These were woven and were very strong. Cows in the habit of crossing fences were tied by the legs with these spansils also.   I have been informed that a branch of a tree was often hung on the roof of a cow house formerly to bring, as the old people thought, luck on the cattle.
