The corn was very plenty those days and it was one of the chief foods the Irish people used.  Every farmer kept his own mill to grind it, that mill consisted of two heavy flags called querns.  In each there was a large hole cut in the middle with a handle of iron secured on to the upper part that used to be twisted by the left hand.  The corn used to be put into this hole by the right hand; and each family used to grind as much in the evening as would do them next day.  Very little cooking was needed for this oaten meal.   It used be generally put into new milk and each person would get his own bowl of milk and meal.
