The hides were steeped in a solution of oak bark for periods from three weeks to three months, according to the class of hides used and the quality of leather desired. The lather produced had a great reputation for long wear. The industry appeared to have been carried on for well over a century and considerable quantities were sent to England.

Lime was sprinkled on the hair of the skin, and the skin buried to exclude the air. The action of the lime separated the hair from the skin.    When the hair was removed, oak bark was boiled in water. Alum was mixed with this water and the skin steeped in it for eight or nine days. It was then taken out, stretched and nailed to a timber frame, or to the back of the door and dried in the sun and wind.    One side of it was then coated with copperas water.

When they would have the skin taken off they used to shake dry lime on it and hang it on a line until it became dry and stiff and if it was damp it would decay if it was not made into leather quickly.
