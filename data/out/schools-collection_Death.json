Pisreoga about Wakes & Funerals.The old people who are now dead had several customs and pisreoga connected with death. A tick in the wall was a sign of death. This tick was called the \"Death watch\". The old people used to say that a sure sign of death was to see a sick person throwing the clothes down off him. When a dog was heard crying in the night time it was a death warning to any sick person in the village. The crying of the banshee was a death warning. An image called \"Colann gan Ceann\" used to be seen, and the person who saw it, died soon after. To hear a hen crowing is also a sign of death. If a leather bat took a rib out of a persons head when flying over him, that person would die soon after. It is not right to throw out dust or ashes in a house where there is a corpse. When a person dies in a house, it is right to stop the clock. People should wash all the clothes in the bed or in the room where a corpse was. Even toilet covers, the table-cloths, etc. should be at least wet. When the woman of the house is hanging out the clothes to dry, two of the neighbouring woman should accompany her.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Sruthar (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Shrule, Co.

Again the proceedings halted, and the ringing was not heard, then one of the parties moved on yet the bell was silent, and did not ring again till the second funeral which was that of a man named Mc Elhill (Anglicised Temple) began to move when it was heard sending forth a clear sounding note. Wondering greatly the two parties completed their journey to the place of burial.The incident gave rise to much discussion for a long time afterwards, but was eventually forgotten. Then one day some turf cutters found about the same place where the bell had first been heard a queer shaped bell embedded in the peat. The mouth of the bell was not circular but square and the whole resembled a gin bottle with the neck knocked off and  did not taper so much. It was carried to the parish priest who had it rung on the occasion of a funeral of any member of the family of the person whose burial it was first heard.

The old name of the place where Muckross Abbey was built in 1340 is thought by some to mean Oir-Bhealach or the Eastern Pass.  The old people of this locality has it as a tradition that Oirbhealach or Irellagh was the name given to the roadway leading from Muckross Abbey by Castlelough, thence through Faugh to the River Flesk where it crossed at a shallow ford and thence eastwards to Muskerry and Duhallow.  This ford was called \u00c1th na gCorp or the Ford of the Corpses for it the custom to leave the coffin on the right bank of the Flesk if the river was in flood and it was considered too dangerous to attempt to cross.  Sometimes it was found necessary to wait two or three days before the funeral could proceed by the age-long route to Muckross Abbey.  According to local tradition, when Owen Ruadh OSullivan, the poet, died as a result of a blow, his remains were brought to the burial place of all the OSullivans, Muckross Abbey.  When the funeral reached \u00c1th na gCorp at Minish the river was in high flood.  The waters did not subside for two days during which time relays of the friends of Eoghan and of the people of the neighbouring townlands kept watch over the coffin.

Sometimes the crosses are placed in that position after the making of the grave is completed.  The spade and shovel used are then placed across the open grave so as to form a cross. (Croom).I have spoken to several workmen who, at one time or another, have made graves, both in thechurchyard in Croom, and in Anhid - same Parish - and they all agree that only two crosses are put down.  \"A Priest tells me, however, that he saw *three such crosses in a grave in Bulgadin graveyard (and Kilmartin).  * He has since told me that there were only two.

Priests, and especially old Priests, of whom, as I write I have two in mind, found themselves unable to negotiate the course round the graveyard, and so insisted that the coffin should be borne directly to the grave.  However, the origin of this custom of going round the graveyard with the coffin, was explained to me - as he had heard it explained when a boy - by John Farrell, 74 years, Manager, Croom Mills.  He says, that when \"The wolf was very plentiful in Ireland, they used often make a descent on newly made graves, tear them open and bring forth and devour the remains.  In order to throw the wolf off the scent, the remains therefore, were carried round the graveyard before being interred, and in order to baffle the wolf still further, a blanket of sod from the field, some distance away, was placed over the newly made grave, into which above the coffin were put a number of heavy stones.
