I was only a small garsun when my father carried me with him to Limerick.  One day as we were going past, there did a poor man come out of it, and he bent nearly double. And God bless and save us all, he had such a awful face, that he frightened the life out of me.  His mouth God bless the mark, was turned back towards his ear, and so his head and face with all respect, was like a pigs.  I heard afterwards about him, that his father and his people before him were very honest.  The father got into debt somehow, and he died before either he could pay it or before his son, the poor man I am talking about was born.  When the father died, the mother said that she would have every hapenny of his debt paid before her child would be born, or else she wished that her child might be an example. Well she wasn't to pay the debt, and so when the child was born, he was an example.  Tisn't right to make a wish like that.  The window was so small, because they wanted to avoid the window tax.

It was a great \"stir\" in the locality when it came to be known that Warburton was going to marry Mary MacNamara.  But stranger still, this Mary MacNamara turned Protestant.  She was much younger than Warburton.  The marriage took place about the year 1899.  There were four children all of whom were reared in the Protestant faith.  The following are the names of the childrenOlga Victoria (The Eldest)Vera IreneViolet GlissendaHenry Haskell (The Youngest)These four children are still living but no one can tell where they are or whether they are married.
