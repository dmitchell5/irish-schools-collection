There are different kinds of cloth used in these shirts such as: poplin, silk and fancy cotton. Long ago the women used to make all the shirts which the men used to wear. The men used to cultivate the ground and grow the flax. They then used to pull it and steep it in lint dams, and spread it in rows in a green field. They then used to stook it until it would season and dry it beside the fire. The women used to scutch it with a scutching handle and clove it with a clover. They then used to hackle it with a hackle and spin it with a spinning-wheel into thread. They then used to send it to a weaver  to be woven on a loom.

He does not stock the cloth, and when a person wants to make a suit he brings the cloth to a tailor. In former times the tailor came around and made the suits in the houses. He uses a thimble, scissors, sewing machine, tape, thread and needles. There are two tailors named Fahy and McGrath in Mount-Bellew, and there is a tailor named Horan in Ballygar.  My mother makes our own shirts. She buys the cloth in a shop and then she makes them. When a person dies, the relatives wear black clothes. When people are getting married the relatives wear bright clothes. Long ago there was a spinning-wheel in every house but there is only one in the district now.

A few men would take off their shoes and stocking and tramp the bed of mud and another man would keep throwing water on it while doing so.

He joins his hands together and rolls the mud up, then he shapes it into hand turf, he puts the [track?] of his five fingers into the centre of the turf and top and bottom are wider than the centre. Then they are saved like spade turf nowadays.Spinning and carding.When the wool is taken off the sheep it is taken in to the house and butter mixxed with it then it is teased before the fire to let the butter melt through it. Then you get your cards and put a piece of wool on one of the cards and rub it up and down as hard as you can against the other one until the piece of wool is fine and clean. She keeps at that until she has it all carded.

They were eaten for Breakfast and dinner and Yellow meal gruel for supper. The kind of milk was skim-milk and this was mostly sour. All cream was taken off and made into butter. This butter had to be sold to pay the rent. The table was by the wall, and at one time barley meal bread was used but later when yellow meal was made into bread this had to be wet with boiling water. Meat was seldom used but every Sunday night for supper. This was American bacon which was bought in a shop. People never killed meat for their own use for they could not afford to do so.

When it is fully grown it has a pretty blue flower. It is then pulled, and tied in sheaves and taken to a boghole and put under the water for about 14 days. Then it is taken up and spread out to dry in a bare field. This process is called bleeching. It is next gathered into sheaves again and put into a house to dry. Then it is broken on the floor with a bittle until the husk separates from the fibre. Next it is cloven by women with cloven tongs. It is again tied in sheaves and then goes through a process which is called hackling. By this the tow is separated from the flax. The flax is then spun into thread by a woman with a linen wheel.

Secondly we get linseed-meal which is used for poultices. Thirdly is the tough fibre which we make into linen, the most beautiful cloth in the world. The flax after being pulled is dragged through iron combs to tear off the seed-pods. After the flax stems have been steeped for about fourteen days the plants are taken from the water and dried. It is then bleached and taken to the threshing-floor where it is beaten with wooden mallets in order to get the soft fibre.

A heavy stone was then placed on the rolls to press them.The rolls were then spun into thread, the thread was then wound into balls usually weighting ten or twelve pounds. The threads were singled out and warped. Twelve feet of a wall was required for the warping, pegs were placed at different positions along the wall. The threads were netted through the pegs. It was then plaited to prevent it from tangling and again made into balls. It was next sent to the weaver and made into cloth, then it was washed, dried, and made into suits, jackets or \"banins\". It had then to be sent to the dyeing mills to be dyed black.Some people made their own dye. This was made in the following way - A pot of water was got from a rushy part of the land. The wool was put into the pot, a number of olive branches are broken and placed on the wool, then a \"coat\" of black alluvium was put over this and the water is poured on. It was then boiled, and when boiled it was left beside the fire for four days. It was then taken  out of the dye-pot, washed and dried.

There is a special class of soil suitable for its growth, neither too rich or too poor. The flax grown on rich soils would not be suitable as the fibre would be too soft and in damp weather would be liable to rot in the soil. There is a great division of labour in the manufacture of linen from flax It has to be pulled out of the soil by the hand, and then has to be steeped in flax ponds or rivers or lakes. The most suitable water is bog water where the turf is not black The object of steeping is to soften the fibre. It requires at least a fortnight in the steeping pool.
