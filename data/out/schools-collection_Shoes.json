Boots are now bought in the shops but fifty years ago they were all made locally by hand and to measure.  There are no boot makers now but some of the old ones still do repairing.  The change came about by the importation of machine made boots and shoes from English factories.   Clogs were made in this locality fifty years ago and were worn by labourers and farm workers.  An attempt was made a few years ago to revive the manufacture of clogs but it ended in failure for want of patronage.  Leather was made here in former years but the last of the tanners, a man named William Sheerin died about sixty years ago.  There is one man living near this town at present who never wore any foot covering even in the coldest weather.

We know that leather was made locally as there are two tan-yards in [?] were worn by some of the people. Some woman and me are wearing clogs about the house in the winter to keep them warm.

It was very usual to see boys and girls going to mass without shoes; and when men and women walked all the way from this place to Sligo town they generally carried their shoes with them until they were almost in town, when they put them on.

In the cold weather they wear clogs or boots and woollen stockings which are made at home.In former years people did not wear boots till they arrived at the age of sixteen or seventeen years and the women hardly ever wore boots except when going to Mass, to town, to a corpse house or funeral.  It was no uncommon thing to see big boys and girls going to mass or to school barefooted.  Before retiring to rest the feet had to be washed and the water used for this was left in the vessel in the house till morning.There is not even one shoemaker in the district at present and boots or shoes requiring repair are taken to Frenchpark or Ballaghaderreen or Boyle.  Some years ago there were two very good shoemakers in the locality and these made and repaired boots for most of the people in the parish.

Bunions are also caused in the same way. The old people say chillblains may be cured by using a spoon of breadsoda mixed with lampoil. When mixed rub it hard to the chillblaine in front of a fire.

In summertime nearly all children go barefoot and adults also go barefoot when working in the bog.  There is nothing special done with the water in which the feet are washed or there are no customs or beliefs connected with it.  Boots are repaired locally but are not made locally they are bought in the shop.  In former times there were two shoe-makers in Borrisokane whereas there is only one now.

June 23rd 1938About one hundred years ago it was an old custom that all the beggars used to get their feet washed at the monasteries and churches on a certain day every year as they never wore boots and this was done as a preventative to disease. Everyone should try and wash their feet at least once a week, because if you cut your foot and had dirty feet the dirt would get into the cut and then it might turn to blood poison. The poison might go through your whole system and in the end lead to death.Children go in their bare feet in Summer, but they always wear boots the rest of the year as the weather is colder than the Summer weather. Some children wear sandals as they are cheap now. About a century ago most of the people used t wear clogs which were made of wood. In this town about fifteen year ago clogs were made by a man named Mr Patterson. He got sale for them in the winter season in the local towns.The water which you wash your feet with should be thrown out or if not a piece of burning coal should be put in it.

Patrickswell N.S.Care Of The Feet.Most people are careful to wash their faces and hands regularly, but do not always pay the same attention to the feet.  In this parish people like to bathe the feet in warm water.  To which a little boric powder is added .  Some prefer salt in the water as this hardens the feet and helps to keep away \"corns\" and \"welts\".  In olden times when boots were not worn generally very few suffered from these modern ailments.  People who visit Kilkee in summer find great benefit from walking in the salt water.  They claim that is is a good cure for corns.  The soreness disappears at least for the time being.  My grandfather says that long ago when the foot bath was finished.  The water was always thrown out to the left hand side of the door.  Piseoga - a belief exists that this was lucky. Numerous are the cures for corns in this locality.  \"(?) paste\" seems most popular.  Others such as \"Tinori\", \"Flit\" and \"radis\" are also used.  After a nice foot bath a person gets a better sleep and the resultant benefits from the \"care of the feet\" are now better understood and appreciated here. A frequent change of socks is also very good.  Perspiration is continually going on and sometimes the boots and shoes worn are not impervious to water, so that a frequent change of socks  - say twice a day is very necessary.  Toe nails should be pared regularly.  An in-growing toe nail can be very troublesome.\n", "school_info": "School: Tobar P\u00e1draig", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Patrickswell, Co.

Before that time the youths never knew what it was to have a pair of boots until they were at least seven years old. Their feet were so hardened by wear and weather, they never minded. In fact such things as bunions were unknown. It was an old belief that to walk in the morning dew barefoot before sunrise was a preventive as well as a cure for such ills.

There is a short description given of a man who went to bed without throwing out the water in which he had washed his feet. About 2 o'clock he was called to throw out the water, but he did not obey. The voice called him the second time to get up quickly. When he was called the second time the man had to obey. This is why people are so careful to throw out the \"feet-water\".There are no shoemakers in this district nowadays and people have to take their shoes\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Maoilinn (C.), \u00c1th Treasna", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Meelin, Co.

People used to take cow skins to a mud house between Rathcoole and Millstreet. Here they were allowed to harden, and some kind of leather produced. Boots made here were sold at five shillings per pair. They were comfortable for people who had tender feet. Mrs O'Connor's grandfather wore them, but he went bare-footed just as often.

Country people at that time wore clogs for working. Clogs were made with wooden soles, and leather uppers assembled with a narrow light hooping fastening  the upper and sole. Hooping (light iron bands) was also fixed on the sole to prevent slipping, and to prolong the wear. When the clogs were purchased, they were filled with 'insoles' made from rabbit skins tanned with 'alum', the furry side being turned to the feet. They were kept on with a strap and buckle, and could be bought in the shops for three shillings and six pence. Two brothers lived in Banteer village at that time and made a living, by making soles for clogs. They bought the timber (beech)from Mr Leader Rosnalee, Banteer, carted it to their workshop , cut it in suitable pieces, and made soles in a rough manner. These were sent away to a factory, properly finished there by machinery, and sold. The waste wood was sold to the local people  at three pence per bag. Journey-man shoemakers used to come to the houses at that time, to make and repair shoes. These had to be supplied with the materials.
