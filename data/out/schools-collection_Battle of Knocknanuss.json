The soldier  seeing the unprotected part drove the sword through the warrior's back and he fell dead off his horse.The man who killed Mac Donnell is said to have been the owner of a small landed property near Charleville which has long since passed away from name and family although some of the latter still reside in the neighbourhood.

It rises up suddenly from a small river which runs by the north west side. It is a long low hill and it is about three miles from Kanturk. The word Knocknanuss has three meanings namely the hill of the bushes, the hill of the fawn, and the hill of the weasels. It is about five hundred feet in height. The slope is gradual on the southern side but it is very steep on the northern side. It is arable land for I suppose \"the red rain makes the grass grow\" In the year 1641 there was a rising in Ireland Lord Inchiquin was in command of the English troops in the south. Lord Taffe was in command of the Confederates that is the real Irish and the old Anglo Normans. Owen Roe was general of the Spanish army. He came over from Spain and took command of the Irish army and he had an European reputation. He was a nephew of the great Hugh O'Neill. He was coming down from the north to fight Cromwell. He died at Cavan having been poisoned by an English spy. Morrough the Burner was doing great slaughter in Munster and had put one hundred priests to death at Cashel. The Papal Nuncio was angry at this.
