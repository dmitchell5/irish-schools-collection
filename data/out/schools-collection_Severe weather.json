They are often heard talking of the terrible storms of olden times, of the damage which those storms did to crops and houses, and of the fear they put in the hearts of the people. Some of the old people were very much afraid of storms, and they say that it was often they stood awake all night, thinking that the house would fall on them every minute. Old women, it is said, prayed hard for the protection of the crops and houses from the wind.          They were more afraid of wind than of anything else, as hay and straw were toppled over, and blown afar off, and scattered here and there among the fields.  Old people could tell when a storm was approaching, by giving a glance at the sky, which, they say, would be as red as blood. That was said to be a sure sign of a storm. If they saw the sky in such a state, it is then they would get busy getting ropes and sticks to put on the hay and straw for their protection.

About thirty years ago he was working in Scotland he met an old Irishman who emigrated there with his parents when only a little boy. He told him he was in Ireland the night of the Big Wind. He was very fond of telling all his friends about that terrible night and he told them about it so often that they called him The night of the Big Wind. When he was describing it for them he wanted to make it appear so violent he said it rooted up the Protestants out of their graves. When a child he lived near a Protestant graveyard in which a lot of old trees were growing . The roots of those old trees spread all over the graveyard. When the trees were knocked the roots were dragged out of the ground by their weight and all their coffins that were buried on them were pulled up also. That was his funny way of telling of the harm that was done by the Big Wind that night. Nearly thirty five years ago we had another great storm . It came very suddenly and did a lot of damage to houses and property.  One man in this parish says he saw 12 acres of trees knocked after it. The roofs were swept off the houses and were blown away for a long distance. Ricks of hay were scattered about in all directions and the farmers sons were busy next day gathering it all up again. Another man went out to feed his cattle that were in the houses and there was nothing to be seen but the stakes to which they were tide. There were a lot of cattle and sheep killed by it on Keeper Hill. In the year 1903 we had a terrible heavy snow storm.

The most interesting thing about the storm is that it lasted only two hours. But in that short length of time it did much damage. One man in this locality had a reek of straw and it was blown away and never seen again.In June 1903 two men from this locality went across to Clare by boat to bring over a fiddler for a night.

The storm of February 1903 did considerable damage to some house-roofs. Lightning seems to strike very much in the vicinity of Corn Hill. As iron stone is found in the bed of the Blacksticks River it thought that lightning may be attracted to this district by deposits of iron ore in the ground. During the past forty years at least four dwellings were struck by lightning and inmates injured, death resulted in one case. Nothing is known about the time or circumstances of the \"Big Snow\". There was a great frost in 1878 which lasted for six weeks. A drought and great heat in 1887 lasted for three months.

There was a big one here in Athboy, Co. Meath, in December of the same year. The sky was as black as could be and on account of all the news of oversea storms, the people prepared for a storm.  It started up in Dublin and by degrees it came down here. It raged for about a fortnight, and in the end it finished off with a great downfall of rain. During its stay, the storm overturned haycocks, blew down trees and did a lot of other damage.There was a fairly big storm about four years ago, which did a lot of damage too. A shop window owned by Mr. Cusack, Chapel St., Athboy was completely blown in and smashed. In 1850 there was a great thunderstorm in Athboy. The people were very frightened of the great rattles of thunder, which sounded like heaps of stones falling.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Athboy (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Athboy, Co.

That night the people were aroused by the great noise of the thunder and heavy hail-stone. It lasted all that night and a great part of the next day. A great deal of cattle were killed and the people were unable to do any out-door work. Many out-houses and trees were knocked but I don't think any dwelling houses were. I think a woman who was sick for some time before it, got a great shock and died a few days after. This great storm occurred in the month of November about the year 1893 and it is known since as \"The night of the big thunder\".There was also a heavy fall of snow and it was said that it lasted for a week and it was six feet in depth.\n", "school_info": "School: Rois\u00edn", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rusheen, Co.
