But when they were about half way across the lough the ice broke and the two poor boys were drowned. \tTheir father and mother searched all night long but could not find them.

Before he went he had a row with his mother and she said to him \"that you may never come back\". On his way he had to cross the canal. When he reached the canal and when he saw the breadth of it he got afraid and he said he would not cross it. The men that were cutting the canal began to laugh at him. But he got ashamed of himself and he started across it, but when he was on the middle of the plank his head gave away and he was drowned. It was about four o'clock when he was drowned and at the very same time there was a neighbour going to his house and as he opened the gate in off the road the man went in after him and he passed him out. He spoke to him but he did not even look at him. The neighbour was surprised when the man did not speak to him, He followed the dead man up the path and when he was just on top of the hill the man disappeared before his eyes.This is a real true story.

The people of the locality fish there and bathe in the Summer time, and many of them have boats in which they row up the Inny and across to Ballinalack.About fifty years ago a party of men women and children rowed on a Sunday to Ballinalack. The men besported themselves and took too much drink. On the way back an argument arose over some dispute between two of the men. They got angry and one of the men stood up in the boat and jumped at the other to strike him. The boat over balanced and threw the whole party into the lake. One of the men took hold of a girl 10 years his daughter and a younger child. He reached the shore with the elder girl but the other was drowned and two other men and a woman.

After he had gone out, the aged servant woman said of him \"That man will never be drowned.\" And when asked \"Why?\" she replied \"He has the drowning mark on him.\" And she explained this by saying that a large MOLE on the face was a mark which preserved the person from death by drowning.Though she called it \"the drowning mark\" it would be more correctly called as may be easily seen \"the no-drowning mark.\"And in this line of Shakespeare the probability is that the two words NO-DROWNING should be connected by a hyphen.\n", "school_info": "School: Killyon", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Killyon, Co.
