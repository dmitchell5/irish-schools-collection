They kept a lot of hens and a fine rooster. But as the foxes were plentiful in the district they stole all the hens but the rooster, and in order to save him Ned Weir took him home to his own house and made a roost for him under the kitchen table.One night shortly after this as he was coming home he saw a fox lying as he thought dead on the roadside. He picked it up and took it into the kitchen intending to save the skin for a fur. While he turned round to take off his coat the cunning fox who had only been shamming jumped up snapped the rooster and ran out with him to the consternation of poor Ned.The story shows us of the wonderful cleverness and slyness of the fox in order to get his ends accomplished.\n", "school_info": "School: Shannagh", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Shannagh, Co.

Hens disappeared nightly and ultimately men with guns kept watch for him. He was so clever however that they could not get within range of him. He became so bold that he actually took away the hens in daytime when the women were feeding them. On one of these occasions a number of young men gave chase and followed the fox over to the cliff bound shore. The fox disappeared over a cliff which had a sheer drop of 70 or 80 ft to the rocks below. When the young men reached the place and looked down the concluded that the foxe's days were ended. However the hens continued to disappear and the people recognised the old fox again. He was hunted again and disappeared at exactly the same spot. A curious young man, on examining the spot noticed that a briar bush overhung the precipice. Lying in hiding close by, he saw the fox on the occasion of the third hunt swing himself over the cliff by the aid of the briar and land on a ledge a few feet down.

She used to go out every day gathering sticks. One day she was going out she saw a fox so she locked the door. When the fox saw her locking the door he crept up along the chimney and he said that he would catch her. When he went up on top of the chimney he could not get in. He said to the little red hen \"Take me down and I won't touch you\". So the little hen took him down. As soon as she did that the fox opened his bag and said now I have you so he put her into the bag. The little hen used always wear an apron and in the pocket she used to keep a scissors a needle and thread. So the fox went home to his house and there were two other young foxes at home to boil the water for the big fox if he had any fowl.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Cnoc\u00e1n an Teampaill, Ros Gr\u00e9ine", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Knockantemple, Co.
