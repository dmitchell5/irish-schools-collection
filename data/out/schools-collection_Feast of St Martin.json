This blood is not supposed to be used for filling puddings or cooking in any way. The blood is often put on a piece of \"tow\" or a cloth and then used during the year to put up to a pain in the side or other pains in the body. It often happens around here, that a pig or a sow gets sick during the year, and the man or woman of the house cuts the ear of the sick animal, and offers it up to St. Martin. If this animal survives, it is usually killed on St. Martin's Night and the blood is allowed to flow around the farmyard.The following story is told by Daniel Flynn, Postman, Ballyduff who was present in the house, with five others when this happened.At the south end of the village of Ballyduff, there lived a poor old widow, who is dead for a good many years.
