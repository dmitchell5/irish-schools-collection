July 8th, 1938. Roads were made to enable us to drive motor cars, and buses, to ride a bicycle. They are made by the County Council. The main road from Oldtown to Dublin is about thirteen miles long. Many men were killed on this road. My Grandfather Patrick O Connor of Wespalstown was killed at Saint Margaret's and there is a cross erected where he was killed. William Gannonwas killed up at the Ward and Peter Reynolds was killed on the Ballyboughill road. Long ago the boys and girls used to meet at the cross roads to sing and dance. The old people used to tell stories. The road from Ballyboughill leads to Dublin, Donabate, Malahide, Lusk and Rush. There are a lot of lanes that are not used in this district. There is one near Wyanstown which leads out to Mallahow. There is another lane in good repair which leads out to a place called Sneiveouge [?] and it is called Markey's Lane. There is a lane called the Wren's nest lane which leads to Rolestown, and there is another lane on the Dublin road called the Green lane which leads out to Palmerstown. There is a lane at Wyestown called the \"Bog lane\" and it leads to a road, the \"Folly Road\" which leads to Palmerstown.

The old man did as he was told. When the game was over, each fairy sat on his hurley, and said \"High over to London\", and all were taken up into the air, and vanished out of sight.

He began to think how happy he would feel, if he could only get home and take the cart with him.

The cow died at Sullivan's (the Hedge School).\n\n\n\nHides of sheep, with the wool pulled off, made trousers.  When wet, it got so long, that it went down to the feet.  When it dried with the fire, it got short and only stretched as far as the knees.

A layer of tree logs were laid down first and over the logs was placed a thick layer of whin bushes closely matted together.

It is a very useful road and a lot of carts are seen on it. Many loads of turf are carted down that road from the hill. As well as in the summer, turf are carted all year for selling. From this road many lanes and other roads branch off. Such as the road leading to the school, known as the Gortin road. On the road leading to Clunelly each division is known by the townland it passes through. There is a part of that road between Meedinmore and Umbally called the moss road, because a moss lies on one side of it.

The road leading by Castlegrove Station was the road formerly used to lead Westport and to the West of Ireland, but many years ago owing to the poverty existing, the English Government started the Relief Works and straightened the road in many parts, so the new part of the road which was them made runs by Hanrahans railway cottage. Men were working on those Relief Works at x per day.In 1847 and 1848 the river Clare was deepened and a lot of corn mills were closed down owing to the water being put under one bridge.

It joins the \"banagher\" road with the Drumagelvin road and it is a winding path of about two and a half miles long. It is barely wide enough for a cart to pass in parts and was the nearest route for many people who come to mass or for burial in the graveyard of Mullandoy. This byroad runs across a river - the river Fane and was crossed at a shallow part by means of a ford or wooden bridge. The bridge was swept away on two occasions by the floods but it has not been disturbed for years. It is still a wooden ford, and is known locally by the name \"wooden bridge\" or \"Moy bridge\".

But as the world advanced and with it education and the sciences main roads were laid out by civil engineers connecting the cities towns and villages throughout the country. At first the roads were metalled by coarse limestone material and the ground was very rough under foot and rather heavy for the progress of vehicles. To correct this the inventive minds taxed themselves until the present smooth steam rolled roads superseded most of the others.In the local district the first roads would appear to be made some years after the famine of 1848 and as the people of this country about that time were in woeful want the English government introduced road-making so as to give them a means of sustenance. The main road locally is called the new line and connects Limerick and Cork via Croom, Charleville and Mallow. In the old Limerick to Cork road via Bruff, Kilmallock and Charleville stones on the side of the road called mile stones showed the mileage from each of the cities named and on some points of the road at present those stones are discernable.

The road which leads from the Church to the Presbytery was also made lately.

From its position near the dwelling house this little patch is admirably situated for an outhouse. In years gone by it is stated that small buildings were erected here on at least two occasions and each time they were mysteriously knocked to the ground. Within the last 15 years a brother of the present Mrs Coby, being a tidy and industrious man built a little shed in the place once more but with the same results. One morning soon after been completed it was found levelled to the earth. But this isn't all. The man who built it took suddenly ill and died.

This road leads from Cloughan crossroad to the village of Delvin.The Lodge road takes its name from the lodge situated on it. It is about one of the oldest roads in the district. In former years this road was the main road from Mullingar to Kells. There are a few house on this road. This road leads from Cloughan crossroad to Rockview.

Some wore ear-rings, some pig-tails, some big \"baggy\" cloloured trousers. These latter were called \"Petticoat\" men. There was life everywhere. The bustle and noise of business was the music of the town.Horses and carts carried grain into the large stores on the Quay from all over the countryside.Nothing is left to tell of its former greatness but the huge seven storey stores along the quayside. Alas! these are now empty; and rotting floors, doors, etc only great the eye. The walls are substantially built, however, and show no sign of decay yet.(See page 82)In those good old days great wages were paid for loading and unloading a ship as it would be a hurry to avail of a propitious wind or tide. A man ( Mr. J. Power Maudlins ) told me to-day that 21s/= per day was refused on the Quay of Ross on one occasion.New Ross made many sailors and emigrants in those days, some going to S.

It consisted then of one oblong room filled with seats and a simple wooden pulpit.  It was customary for the Protestants to meet here at certain times (week-days as well as Sundays).  The ministers did not conduct \"Services\" here, but instead there were long preachers.  One of these men was a Mr. Lowe from Mountmellick who was employed in Smith's establishment.  Another was a Mr. Lewis who lived in Portarlington and who had a grocery shop there.  It is remembered that the Protestants used to attend morning service in the Church on Sundays and come back in  the evening to \"The Preaching House\".After this was discontinued it was sold for about \u00a330 to a local committee (Catholics) who used it for dances, entertainments, meetings, etc.  Recently it was rented to a Catholic young man named James Tinkler.

It got that name because it passes through Tinnamuck.The Castle Road runs from Killahan-Tubber to Ballycumber.

It was men from Ross that made Carbery's road because the people in this district would have nothing to do with the new road making they believed misfortune would overtake them if they had anything to do with them. These men had their food at Rahine where William Sweetnam lives now. His grandmother was a Ross girl by the name of Kingston so that she was the only woman these men knew in the district. She gave them plenty of \"ropey milk\" and yellow meal boiled. They had their own bread. When she visited her home in Ross on horse back behind her husband they always gave her a great welcome for her kindness to them.
