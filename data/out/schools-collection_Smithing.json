A forge is generally built at a crossroads is some other central place so as to be convenient for people who come from the neighbouring villages to get their horses and donkeys shod.The forge is a low-sized slated building. There is a high arched door with two little hobs on either side, leading into it. The interior of the forge is not very large but the fire and the bellows take up a lot of space.Usually only one man called the blacksmith works in the forge. Occasionally he needs help. Ms. Keville owns the forge being in the family for two generations. Mr. Keville is a hard-working industrious man. As well as shoeing horses he also mends farm implements, but he does not make them. He makes kitchen utensils such as tongs, smoothing-irons, and pot-hooks.The chief implements which the blacksmith uses are, the bellows, the anvil, the hammer, and the pincers. The fire is always alight because in order to be able to bend and twist the different articles of iron into shape they must first be reddened. The bellows are used to blow the fire\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Balla (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Balla, Co. Mayo", "Teacher:": "\nKatie M.

There is generally about four acres sown. Some years we sow more and some less than that amount. It depends generally on the kind of weather at the time of sowing. We commence sowing in March. The ploughman ploughs the ground in the Winter to let the frost break the lumps and air the soil. The ground is harrowed in the Spring. The ground is not manured until the potatoes are ready to be sown. In some places the manure is ploughed into the ground. The potatoes are sown in drills but long ago they were sown in the ridges. In most places the drills are made with the plough but usually the spade is used in small gardens. Wooden ploughs have not been used here in recent years but they are still to be seen in the west of Ireland and also in Spain. When the iron ploughs were made the farmer gave up using the wooden plough. Very few are left here now. The spades are made in the local forges and towns.

The people say that Mr. Caufield is the best for shoeing horses, donkeys and race horses but Mr David Traynor the owner of the other forge is the best for implements.
