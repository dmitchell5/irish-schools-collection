When the field was finished he said he would take the horse home, and so saying he jumped up on his back. The horse sped away but instead of going to the man's home he plunged into lough and they both sank beneath the water, and neither of them was seen again.From that time there is a cure in the lough and people go there to get cured of swelling.

He took a lump of earth and struck one of the horses and immediately it stood but the other six horses disappeared into the lake. He caught the horse that stood and bred her and she had seven foals which Mahoney sold and made a great deal of money of them.
