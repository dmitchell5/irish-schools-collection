Here St Patrick preached to them for a considerable time. After his sermon was finished he was very thirsty. He asked where he might get a drink. He was shown to a well in a adjoining field. He went to the well and having drunk from it, he blessed it as was his custom whenever he drank from a well . After that the well became a holy one and for hundreds of years was a place of pilgrimage. Then a certain priest living in Kinlough, fearing that the devotion was in danger of being abused and that too much reverence was paid to it had the well filled in.
