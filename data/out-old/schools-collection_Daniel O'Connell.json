There was a Catholic man and a Protestant man. The Catholic man was very wealthy and the Protestant man was very poor, he was so poor that one day he asked the other man for the loan of five pounds. The Catholic man gave him the money. Then it happened that the protestant man got very wealthy and the other man got very poor. He did not like to ask the protestant for his money but he got so poor as he was not able to buy anything he wanted so he went to the protestant man and asked him for the five pounds. The man denied the Catholic had ever given  him any money.The Catholic man did not know what to do then so he went to Daniel O' Connell and he told him his story. Daniel told him to go to every house and ask lodging for the night and to be sure to ask lodging in the protestant man's house. The man did not know whether he would do this or not and Daniel said he would do it himself. He dressed up like a stranger and went to every house and when he came to the protestant's house the man told him he would surely keep him Daniel O' Connell said he left some old clothes down the town and he said he would go and get them. He went away and he met the Catholic man and he told him to go to the butcher's shop and get two legs of a bullock. The man got the legs and he gave them to Daniel O' Connell.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Gortnacart", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Gortnacart Glebe, Co.

It lies on elevated, uneven ground overlooking Ballinskelligs Bay on one side and Lough Luigheac on the other.The name Eightercua conveys little or no meaning to us but when written in Irish characters - \"\u00cdochtarcuadha\" we can come to some conclusion as to its meaning. The word means the \"end of a hound\" or rather of its life. This certain hound belonged to the famous Daniel O'Connell of Derrynane and one fine morning as his men were out hunting, a hare was roused at the top of Coom a Chiste. The hare was so swift that the dogs soon gave up except Daniel's favourite hound. She followed in hot pursuit until she came to an old ruin near Loch Luigheach. There the hare disappeared and the hound fell dead. That is said to be the reason why the place is called \"\u00cdochtarcuadha\".\n", "school_info": "School: An Clochar, Cathair Saidhbh\u00edn", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Cahersiveen, Co.

Once Daniel went into a big shop in Limerick, Cannock and Taits to buy a coat.  An attendant of shoneen tendencies came to serve him.  O'Connell asked for a scarlet coat.  \"What colour is scarlet\", rather sneeringly asked the shop-assistant.  O'Connell raised the hunting crop he was carrying in his hand, brought it down smartly though not violently, on the man's nose and then said, quite calmly, pointing to the blood which flowed down his shirt font, \"That is the colour of scarlet\".\n", "school_info": "School: Cromadh (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Croom, Co.
