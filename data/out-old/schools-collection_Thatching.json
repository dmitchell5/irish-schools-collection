He puts on one handful after another till he has one piece done.  He fastens each handful as he puts it on.  He changes the ladder over a piece and thatches another piece and so on till he has the roof thatched.  Then he cleans off the loose flax that is lying on the roof.

His name is Micheal Fallon.  He selects the best straw out of the cock first.  Then he goes to the wood and cuts hazel scallops to stick in the thatch to keep it in it's place.  He starts thatching by putting a thick layer of straw at the eve.  Then he keeps putting up layers of straw after one another until he goes to the ridge.  When he has the two sides of the house finished he makes a number of knots out of the loose straw along the ridge.  These are called bobbins and prevent the rain from coming in.

There are two professional thatchers in Drimbane, Curry, Co. Sligo - Thomas Brennan - 82 years and James McIntyre who is nearly 80 years old. Both still practice thatching + are hale and hearty. When preparing for thatching, the oats is threshed off the straw by men with flail. A flail consists of a colpan and buaibein joined together by a gad. (Those are the words used here - I never heard the English equivalents). A threshing machine cannot be used for this work as it breaks up the blades of straw. When threshed the straw is \"drawn,\" that is, the clean straw is placed in the form of a sheaf so that the ends of the blades of straw are even - that is, some do not project. \"Clean\" straw is that which is cleared of weeds + grain; otherwise weeds, oats etc would grow in the thatch The neat preparation is to make the scollops. (Scolb). Medium-sized garden rods are chosen (Each farmer grows his own rods.) A rod is taken, and one or perhaps two scollops are cut from it. A scollop is about three feet long and it is pointed at each end, so that it may be driven easily through the thatch and \"scaws\" (sods) of the roof.

Most of the houses have thatched roofs although during the past few years a number of the houses have been fitted with slate or tiled roofs.The method of thatching done here is called scallop thatching. First a quantity of pliable rods are cut and pointed at both ends. These are called scallops. The straw used is mostly rye or wheaten straw. The seed has first to be removed from the straw by threshing. The thatching is started at the eave and a stroke of straw is lain flat on the roof up to the rigging or highest part. The scallops are then bent and driven through the stroke of straw and in through the old thatch. This holds the straw down in position and prevents the wind from blowing it away.

There are a few good thatchers in every district, who are employed at the work which is generally done in the Winter or Spring when the straw is plentiful and easily handled.     When a person wants to get his house thatched he cuts a big bundle of scollops, either of scally or privet. The scollop will be about one and a half feet long, and sharply pointed at each end. A number of bundles of straw are then made. A ladder is placed by the side of the house and the thatcher ascends and pulls down any old decayed thatch or scollops. He brings up with him a bundle of straw tied with a straw or hay rope, a mallet, and a punching fork.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Forgney, Ballymahon", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Forgney, Co.

There were three types of thatch namely straw, wheaten and rush. The farmers usually planted their oat seed in March and reaped the oats in August. Something similar occured with the wheat except it had to be planted in Winter. The rushes grew wild in the marsh or boglands without any attention. The wheat and oats had to be cut, and reared, and put in stooks in the fields before bringing into the haggard  to be put into stacks. Early in November the farmers took in the oats, and wheat into their barns, and threshed it with flails. The flail was a hand staff, and had a top like a fishing rod tied in the middle with an eal skin, and when the corn was threshed the straw was put out into ricks in the haggard.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Mercy Convent, Granard", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Granard, Co.

The straw is pulled out of a rick then caught at the both ends and chucked to knock the chaff out of it. Then water is thrown on it to wet it. The tools used are a knife, stappler, mallet and a rake. When the thatcher starts to use scallops he bends them. The thatching is done from the eave up to rigging. The width the thatcher takes is one stroke in thatching. That is about two feet in width. Scallops are put in the thatch to keep it firm. Bobbins are put on the top of the thatch. Bobbins are made by twisting the straw under your arm then by bending the straw and taking a little bit out of one of the sides and then it is tied. Before the thatcher starts starts to thatch he tears down all the old moss and thatch to make it level and if there be a hole in it he fills it up with straw.

Houses are thatched with 'reed' that is the straw left after the wheat being threshed. This is fastened on the house with 'scallops'.

They were both widely respected and were perpetually at work. If a farmer wanted a thatcher he would have to wait his turn. Every year each farmer used to grow an acre or so of wheat in a special place. When it was ripe it was never threshed with other corn. It was brought into the haggard and threshed separately so that the straw would remain straight and unbroken. When it was carefully threshed with a flail it was piled in a stack and carefully guarded from the weather. Then the farmer and his family would have to prepare the \"scallops\" which were used to keep the thatch in position. First of all furze were cut and brought into the farmyard.
