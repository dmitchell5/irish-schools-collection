He is said to have been a strict disciplinarian, and to have used the cane freely.  The last of his pupils died a year ago.  Big boys and girls attended his school, especially in the Winter.  The big boys wore corduroy trousers and frieze or home-spun tweed coats, and wore clogs or went barefooted.  The boys wore petticoats and overalls until they were twelve or thirteen years old, and were not dressed in knickers or trousers lest the pull of the braces, would retard their growth, or make them round-shouldered.The best men to wear the old Irish costume were two men named Cullen and Doyle, who died about 1885, and who always dressed in long tailed frieze coats, tight corduroy breeches with brass buttons at the knees, hand-knitted grey stockings, low hob-nailed shoes, and tall flatbottomed hats.
