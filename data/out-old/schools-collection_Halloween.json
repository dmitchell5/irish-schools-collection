Then an apple is thrown in and they try in turns to take up the apple with their mouths. The child who thus takes the apple can eat it.Then an apple is suspended from the ceiling and is kept swinging backwards and forwards, and in turns they try to catch it in their mouths, but this is very difficult.Young grown up girls, and sometimes boys play several games relating to marriage.  They get four saucers and put into them, clay, water, a ring, and a Rosary Beads respectively.  In turn they are blind-folded and led to the vessels.  The person who puts his (or her) hand into the water will go across water; in the clay, will be the first to die; on the ring, will get married the first; on the Beads will be a nun or a Religious.Each in turn then tries to peel an apple\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: C\u00faige", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Coogue Middle, Co.

The people immediately rise to follow them but when they come to the door they find they cannot get out.Another trick is a crowd of them gather at a certain place. Then they part in twos or threes and they go and take gates and carts and everything they can lay their hands on and hide them on their neighbours.A trick played by the younger children indoors is they put a sixpence or a shilling into a basin of water. Their hands are then tied behind their backs and they then try to bring out the money with their mouths.

On this night all the children amuse themselves by playing all sorts of games such as hanging apples from the roof and taking them down in their mouths, putting apples in water and taking them out without putting a hand to them, and putting a sixpence in a tub of water and getting it up in the mouth. After all the games are played they get a large supper with all kinds of bread and all the people of the house sit in to a good repast. There is a cake made in which a ring, a thimble, a sixpence and a piece of cloth are placed. There is great joy on the people while the supper is going on as they are all watching to see what they will get. After the supper is over the old people begin to tell stories and the younger ones listen to them. Long ago it was a custom for the girls to go out with a claw of yarn and throw it down into a lime-kiln. They rolled it up again and if it got untangled they shouted out. \"Who is that holding the thread\" and whatever name would be answered it was he who was to be her husband. Some boys play tricks on their neighbour such as taking something out of its place and bringing it away so that the people of the house would think it was the fairies who brought it away. On Halloweve night, it is said that all the fairies be out and dancing round forts and all the people are afraid to go out on that night lest the fairies would bring them away.\n", "school_info": "School: Coill an tSrotha", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Cullentragh, Co.

In the morning if the yolk of the egg was broken up it would be the sign that you would have misfortune during your life but if not you would have luck. At twelve o'clock they would also go to the nearest cabbage garden and catch the first stump of cabbage they would meet and bring it home.

Children play snap apple and all other sorts of games. They put the apple on a piece of cord and hang it from the ceiling. Then they would try to catch the apple with their mouths. Beans and nuts are also used. Pan cakes are made, and money, rings, and buttons are put in them. A bowl of water and a ring and clay are put on the table. The person who is going to touch one of them is blindfolded, and if he puts his hand in the water he is going to cross the sea, and if he touches the ring he is going to be married, and if he touches the clay he is going to die.

The players hands are tied behind their backs, & they try to get apples in their mouths.Another custom is burning the nuts. A nut for each person in the family is balanced on the grate. Eventually the heat makes them light or smoulder until they fall off. the first one to fall means that the person it is for will go away first & so on.Another game is lighting the candle. Two chairs are placed a small distance apart. Sometimes chairs are placed further apart with a plank between them. The player gets a candle in his hand & a lighted candle is on one of the chairs.He has to get upon one of the chairs & step over with one foot & light his candle with the other one.

A week before Hallow E'en you would see bracks and rings in them, and all sorts of nuts, such as dough nuts, monkey nuts, beech nuts and cocoa nuts in the windows of the confectionary shops. In the country houses the woman of the house has to make a cake and put a ring in it. These are the names of some of the tricks that I play on that night. First of all I get four plates and put them on the table, on one I put water, on another clay on another a ring and on a fourth a beads. It is said that the person who gets the ring will be married first, the person who puts his hand on the water will go across the sea, the person who puts his hand on the clay will die within one year, the person who puts his hand on the beads will die within one year.\n", "school_info": "School: Garrowhill, Longford", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Garrowhill, Co.
