How this man made these nails was, first he got a rod of iron and he would cut a nail's length from it. Then he had a little machine with a hole in it. He would hammer the piece of iron into it so that the nail wold be formed. Then the nail would be as tight as if it were welded into it. Then he would loosen a nut and the nail would fall out made and all. This man's was name was Pat McGrale and he had a son named James. Pat died about 1870.
