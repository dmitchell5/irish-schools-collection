Sometimes the neighbours help each other.When the stalks are above the ground they are clayed. Then they have to be wed.  If the weather is wet they sometimes get the blight and then they have to be sprayed by a sprayer with blue stones and water mixed.  They sometimes have to be sprayed twice or three times.The potatoes are put down in the month of march, and they are dug up in the month of September.  Some people plough them up.  Then they are picked in baskets, and then they are put in pits, or in barns but they keep better in pits.Sometimes starch is made out of potatoes.

When they are all cut they are left in the barn and dry lime is sprinkled on them. They are left there for about a week.Potatoes are usually set in lea land because farmers have found that they produce a better crop then than they do when they are set in stubble. The lea is ploughed into ridges but stubbles are ploughed flat. They are then harrowed and \"scored\" with a plough, that is the ridges are marked out.The potatoes are set in this way: A man has a st\u00edbh\u00edn, that is, a bramble with a step on the end of it, and paired so that a hole can be made in the ground with it.

He fastens one stick in the ground and winds some of the twine round it securing it carefully. Then he takes the rest of the twine and draws it along whatever length he require his ridge making sure to keep it straight. He fastens the second stick to the ground, winding the twine round it.

Most farmers plant about from two to eight acres. The peasants plant about half an acre.The potatoes are sown in drills and not in ridges.At first in spring the ground is ploughed and harrowed. Then the farmer opens the drills and scatters manure in them. He then plants the potato. Some farmers nowadays scatter the manure on the land first and plough it then. This is usually done late in winter when he has not much other work on hands. This also speeds him in spring again.The bigger potatoes are cut in two. Each half must have an \"eye\" in it.When the potato begins to grow weeds also come. Then they are hoed to keep down the weeds. Later in summer they are sprayed with \"Blue Stone\" and ammonia. This makes the potato grow longer and hence it will be bigger and better.In autumn the potatoes are dug by a potato digger which is drawn by two horses. Sometimes they are dug with a plough or with spades.

Most farmers plough the land with an iron plough attached from either one, or two horses, making about forty drills in every acre of land. Manure is purchased from one of the local shops, and is shaken along on each drill. Seven or eight of the neighbours come together, and help one man, whilst some others go, and help another the following day, and so on. Usually on a fine April, or May day, when the sun shines brilliantly, the sowing of pops takes place. The halves, or slits, as they are called, are spaced eight, or ten apart in a straight line. The potatoes are then covered with clay by the plough, or with a spade. Soon the plants appear, and each day, they grow richer, and taller. The weeds get stronger, and more plentiful each day also, as the hoe is procured, with which the weeds are beaten down.When the blight appears, the spraying-can is put in use.

The first ploughing can be done as early as October but the drills are not opened until the middle of the month of April. Farmyard manure is now brought out in a cart and left in lumps here and there along the drills.

The drills are opened with two horses. A furrow is first ploughed and then after that the man opens the drills doing half a drill each side of the double plough; in the single plough he can only do half a drill at a time and by working with a double plough two half-drills are opened at a time.After the farmyard manure is thoroughly scattered artificial manure is put over the farmyard manure.

Some years ago potatoes were planted in ridges by means of spades and men but this method was very slow and spades are little use now. In those days spades were made by smiths but they are now turned out by machinery and much cheaper than formerly. The potato seed is chosen for planting and then cut so that one potato will make two or more seed. It is customary in some districts that neighbouring Farmers help one another at seeding time and in this way the work is got over quickly. When the plants are a few inches high the drills are cleaned by the hand and the furrows scuffled and fresh earth ploughed up to the young stalks. The crop is dug out about the month of October, most Farmers doing so with a potato digger, others plough them out and in some cases they are dug with spades. They are then picked by hand and drawn to the Farm\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Cappa", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Cappagh, Co. Kerry", "Teacher:": "\nT.F.

Potatoes are usually dug in October as they are then ripe. Potatoes are ripe when the potatoes do not adhere to the roots of the stalks. The potatoes are dug by means of an ordinary spade or with a graipe. The digger stands on the ridge, or sometimes in the farrow, when digging. An experienced digger throws the potatoes out on the ridge, so that the \"quire\" or \"corry\" of dug potatoes seems as if the potatoes were arranged by hand. An inexperienced digger, on the other hand, leaves a straggling line of potatoes in his wake, with a certain amount of potatoes left buried in the clay or in the \"shough\" (furrow) A picker follows the diggers. He picks the large potatoes for human use into a can or bucket When the bucket is filled, he empties it into a creel, and so on until the creel is filled. A creel is a wicker vessel which usually holds about 1 cwt of potatoes. The farmer, however, measures the amount of his potatoes by volume called \"barrels.\" A \"barrel\" of potatoes contains ten creels, so that by keeping an account of the number of creels dug, a farmer can estimate almost exactly the amount of potatoes he has.

This kind of a field is called awel-lea. The best time to plough the ground for the potatoes is in Autumn, after the oats have been removed from the field.  But that is a busy time of the year, so the most of the farmers postpone the ploughing until February or (m) March. The kind of soil in this locality is a stiff, cold clay, and the farmers don't like to put in their potatoes too (put) early. Also if the weather is wet and raining they can't work the ground as they do in other districts, where the nature of the soil is light and gravelly.About the middle of April if the weather is good, the farmer harrows the field, and then grubs it with a grubber or cultivates it with a cultivator.He then rolls with a roller to break the lumps. In some fields the lumps are so hard that they have to be broken with a mel.When he has made the soil fine\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Killybrone", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Killybrone, Co.

About 20 or 30 years ago they 'slit' the potatoes in barns and often out beside the potato pits in fields. They select the good seed potatoes and each potato is cut into two or three parts with an 'eye' in each. These parts are called 'slits'.

The potatoes now cut in 'slits' are brought up to the field and slits are left along in rows on the ridges, about 4 slits on the breadth.

Sligo: In olden times - 50 yrs. ago.Long ago before ploughing by horses became common, the crops had all to be done by man's labour.  The ground was dug with a spade to sow potatoes, ridges were made wide enough to sow three seeds across, instead of one as at present: the space or hollow between was called the shough (pro. shuch).  The spade used for digging was called a \"loy,\" it was a narrow spade with a wooden step on one side.  The digger put his foot on this step to  help him to drive down the spade.  The digger was a man's work but girls and women helped with the lighter work such as making the holes with a shteeveen - in which the seed potatoes were put.  It (the shteeveen) was of timber, and had a point for making the hole, and a step on which to put the person's foot, and so drive it down easily to make the hole.  This work could be done very quickly after a little practice.  This was called \"sticking the pots.\"  Another person put the seed in - one in each hole - and this was called \"dibbling\" the potatoes: a third person came along with a spade or shovel, and closed up the holes.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Tullogher, Ros Mhic Treoin", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Tullagher, Co.

Some farmers give a top-dressing of farmyard manure to the land intended for potatoes, and it is afterwards ploughed into the soil with the plough. Potatoes are generally planted in drills. In olden days potatoes were planted in ridges about four feet wide, because there were no ploughs in those days and the work was all done with spades and shovels. Wooden ploughs were also used in olden days, and later iron ploughs were introduced. When the farmer is preparing for the potatoes he ploughs the land at first, and harrows it, and drills are opened with a double mould-board plough.

It is generally ground that corn is sown in the year before that potatoes is sown in the following year.  After this it is levelled.  Then the seeds is stuck with a suf\u00edn.  Manure is put on them and they are shovelled and made into ridges.  Long ago the ground would be dug in December.  Gravel would be put on for manure.  It was generally level ground they would cope.  When the potatoes would be going to be sown the sods would be turned by women and children.  More manure would be put on top of the gravel.  The seeds would be dropped on this.  The sods would be turned on all and moulded.All this would be done by lais.  These instruments were made by blacksmiths.  Spades came out and the lais were wiped out.  These spades are bought in local shops.  In summer they are sprayed twice or three times for fear of the blight.  This work is performed by spraying machines.  In olden times this work was perfomed by a bunch of heather tied together.  This was called a \"besom\".  In October they are dug.  All the different potatoes are put by themselves in a heap.  The small potatoes are called \"porimis\".  The different kinds of potatoes are \"epicures\" \"kerr pinks\" \"victories\" \"arran banners\" \"flounders\" and skerries.

The period is on record about 200 years.Potatoes are vegetables which are more commonly and universally used than any others, and this may be accounted for in several ways. First the flavour is aggreeable, then the supply is generally abundant and so the cost is moderate, and in the third place they can easily be prepared for use. Still as articles of food they are not fitted to support life if eaten alone.The method of boiling potatoes is more economical than the method of roasting them. Young potatoes are far less nutritious than older ones and when peeled carelessly nearly one fourth of their whole weight is lost. On the other hand when boiled in their skins  the loss is only about one ounce in the pound.Each year about one acre of potatoes is grown on our farm and the amount never varies.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Knockcommon", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Knockcommon, Co.

So in early Spring people pick the best seed out. Then they cut them into \"splits\" with an  \"eye\" in each one. There are early and late varieties. These are the names of some early varities Epicure's, Early roses and up to dates. Here are the names of the late varieties Black and white champion's and Kerr's Pink's.

Then you put the bluestone and the water in and mix them together. Then you add the melted washing soda and put it in to the sprayer. There is a thing like a pump in the front of the knapsack sprayer and you work it up and down and there is another at the back where the sprayer comes out. Sometimes people think that they are too slow so they get a horse spraying machine and they get a horse to pull it. Sometimes the potatoes get blight then they are no good.

Then they open the drills and put in about one hundred loads of farm yard manure to the acre, sand bag manure if necessary.The people sow different varieties of potatoes, namely, the Golden Wonders, Sharps Express, Kerr Pinks, Irish Queens, Old Champions, Kerry Champions, .Arran Banners, Spies Abundance,\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Banagher (B.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Banagher, Co.

There is one fault, and that is the acreage under the potato-crop each year is too little, grazing being adopted on a larger scale. The farmers of this locality are the same as all the farmers of Ireland at the present day, they like to avoid labour themselves and leave the horses and machinery to do it. For this reason the potatoes are sown in drills except on rare occasions they might be sown in ridges; a \"bawn\" field is used for the ridges. Manure is spread on the field and it is left there for a day or two, the field is then ploughed with a board plough and so the ridges are made, there are five or six sods in each ridge and a dyke between, one of the sods at the side is known as the \"caolfh\u00f3d\"; there is more earth in this sod than in any other sod in the ridge. The ridges are then hacked with \"graf\u00e1ns\", the earth of the caolfh\u00f3d is spread across the top; work known as \"the sticking of the scol\u00e1ns\" then begins. Men carry the \"scol\u00e1ns\" in pouches, they drive the spades through the sods by leaning on the \"bac\u00e1ns\" with their legs, they then push the handle forward and throw the scol\u00e1ns into the holes behind the spades. When the potatoes are sown the holes are closed with implements known as [?](bailc\u00edns in margin)   For drills a stubble field is ploughed and harrowed, then drills are opened there, two drills take up the same space as one ridge.

Then a man and horses will have to close the drills with a plough. Most of the farmers do all their own business.In ridges it is not so easy.

The spraying is done with a horse sprayer, or a knap-sack sprayer which is carried on the back.The potatoes are dug out in the month of October with a spade or a digger drawn by two horses.
