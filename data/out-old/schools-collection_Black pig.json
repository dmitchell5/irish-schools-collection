St. Molaise imposed on him the penance of perpetual exile, never more to see Ireland. St. Columcille was returning to his home in Derry, after receiving his penance, and when travelling on the shore in Leitrim he wrote a prophesy of the invasions wars, and conquest of Ireland - the land he loved so well. He said that Erin would bleed from every pore for centuries, and that no part of the Island would suffer as much as Leitrim on account of her undying devotion to Faith and Freedom. He wrote :- \" A monster shall arise in the North, and from Skreen in Sligo through the valleys of Breffni, on by Fenagh and South-west Cavan, till is touches Slane in Meath.

Every night she appeared at certain crossroads, in the locality, in the form of a black pig.Any unfortunate person who passed by that cross between midnight and dawn was set upon by the black pig and anyone she touched was dead and dammed like herself. Nobody ever escaped from this black pig and the whole population of the neighbourhood were scared.However, one night a certain farmer's son was called out of bed in order to run for the priest for his dying father.
