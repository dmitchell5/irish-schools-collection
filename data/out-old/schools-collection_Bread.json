The people had to dig the ground with spades. When the ground was prepared they sowed the corn seed and when it was grown up and ripe, they cut it with a reaping hook.

It was then made into big stooks and left in the garden for a fortnight or three weeks, to harden to get ripe.At the end of that time the corn was carted to the haggard and there it was made into big stacks.  After a while it was threshed with flails. When treshed, on a windy day, it was taken out to a field near by. There it was winnowed. That is the wind separated the chaff from the grain. It was then brought to the house and put into sacks. These sacks were then placed before the fire to harden. The corn was then ground into meal by means of a . It was afterwards sived and the finer part was used for making bread while the coarser part was given to the animals to eat.

During the digging of the potatoes the very large ones were left on the side of the ridge. They would be selected for making boxty, and would be preserved for a feast if it was near a feast time. The first thing is to wash them well. Then some people peel them and others don't. Then they are grated on a grater. Then they are wrung in a linen cloth usually. Then it is put out on a table and a little flour is added, along with a couple or three boiled bruised potatoes, and it is spread out on the table and if you like it can be cut in farls and cooked on either a pan or a griddle.

Boxty bread was generally used in old times when the potatoes were partly unsound. The unsound part of the potato was scraped away. Scrapers made of tin, pierced with small holes were used. The potatoes were scraped fine - shredded like shavings at a saw mill. The scrapings were then put into a calico cloth and squeezed, so that they became dry pulp. A flour paste was then made and the pulp inserted, so that the paste covered the pulp on both sides. The method was something similar to that adopted in making an apple pie. The whole was then baked. When baked it was something similar to our modern potato cake, but darker in colour, and of a somewhat tougher texture.(b)Sowens.

An oven is also used for baking bread.About 30 years ago the bread was kneaded on \"a losset\" a square board about 3 ft. square, but nowadays it is kneaded in tin pans.Sometimes a cross is cut on the loaf baked in an oven to prevent the crust from rising off the loaf.Barm made from mashed potatoes mixed with dough is used instead of milk during the Winter season when sour milk for bread-making is scarce.\n", "school_info": "School: Drumdigus (B.), Cill Mhuire", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Drumdigus, Co.

Stampy was made of flour and water and when baked was of a flat nature. The soda cake contained a mixture of flour, bread soda and fermented sour milk and baked in a bastable. After the dough was kneaded and before being placed in the bastable two insertions were made with a knife in the shape of a cross so that the heat would go through the cuttings. Except where there were large families the  bread was usually baked three times a week.

It was made of flour, salt and soda mixed together with buttermilk and was put on a griddle by the fireside to bake.The griddle was a flat round piece of iron and this was laid on a tripod or brand-iron under which burning coals were placed to bake the bread. Potato-cake is made to the present day and when baking it is also laid on the griddle by the fire and turned from one side t the other according as it baked. It was made as follows: - First the potato's were boiled, then peeled and mashed together on a bread-board or in a basin. A little salt was added and when it was well kneaded it was flattened out and cut into strips after which it was put on the hod griddle.When cooked the strips were split in the centre with a piece of thread and each side was well-buttered.

It is said that the station house was built where is is at present to accommodate this trade.  Old people speak here of the \"black\" bread of long ago.  People here like brown bread sometimes. This is made by mixing a little bran with the flour.  It is better for the teeth and general health.A little machine called the \"quern\" was kept in many houses.  The corn was ground between two stones, and sufficient flour was procured to last for a few days.  The potato-cake was one which the people, and especially the children were very fond of in olden times.  Except in very few houses,  it has now gone out of fashion in these parts.  The potato cake was made in the following manner.  The potatoes, left over after dinner, were mashed up, and some flour, butter, salt and pepper.

They had a lot of trouble in making what they did use.  Some of them would have small plots of wheat and oats.  There were very bad ways of making the meal and flour for the making of the bread.  There was a kind of mill stone for the crushing of the corn.  The poorer people often crushed it with two flat stones in their own homes.  The bread used was mostly made of oatmeal, salt, and water, it was called oaten cake.  It had to be made in the morning and left to set until evening or next morning; then baked before a clear turf fire on a grid iron.Some times they had potato cakes.  These were made from potatoes boiled and mashed up with a little salt and oat meal or flour kneaded well together and baked on a griddle.  They made another bread called boxty bread.  It is made with raw potatoes pealed first, then grated to a pulp and mixed with salt and a little flour.

In the country districts homemade bread is mostly used and in the towns and cities the Bakers' bread is generally used. Seldom do the country people buy the Bakers' bread and they are right not to do so because there is no substance in it. It gives you no strength either. On the other hand the homemade bread is the healthier and it is very wholesome and nourishing for everyone, and especially for young people. It helps to build up their bodies according as they are growing up, and people should eat more of it and never mind the Bakers' bread.     At the present day the Bread that the Bakers make is only half baked. Because of that people should not eat it. Still people insist on using it and often in fact use nothing only it. Often people do not know how to bake homemade bread and because of that they buy the other bread.

Told by Maisie O'Loughlin (26).Bread was made from wheat, oats and barley. The flour was made locally. It was never heard that querns were used in this district. The different kinds of bread made were brown bread, wholemeal bread, barley bread, white bread, currant bread, oaten bread and boxty bread. The brown bread is made with flour and wheaten -meal. There is no wheaten-meal put into white bread, and the boxty bread is made with grated raw potatoes.The ingredients used are salt, soda, flour, wheaten-meal and buttermilk for brown bread; salt, soda, flour and buttermilk for white bread; and salt, pepper, ginger and cinnamon for boxty bread. It is either cooked in butter or fat. In nearly every house there was a special day set apart for baking. On this day there was enough baked for nearly a week. On the top of the cake there is a cross put to prevent the crust from cracking. The bread is baked on a griddle pot-over, and oaten bread is usually baked before the fire on a trivet. It is made of light iron. Pancakes are made on Shrove\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Enfield", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Innfield, Co.
