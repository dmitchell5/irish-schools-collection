While the church was being constructed Goban's wife received a present of a milch cow from the saint. This cow was soon after stolen by a thief who infested the neighbourhood. St Wolling sent a party of his people after the thief, and they found him about to roast the cow, which he had killed at a large fire on the bank of the River Barrow.
