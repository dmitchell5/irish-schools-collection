Three persons were killed on each side, and by a strange coincidence a father and son were killed on each side.

Sometimes they drew their batons and charged the combatants, who promptly forgot their grievances against each other, and mutually attacked the police.

But he was caught before he got home, dispossessed of the young lady and warned never to come to the parish again. The Slatterys of O'Brennan brought him in again to dare the Carmodys. Hence the fight. -The priest said that the man who gave the 1st blow would regret it. It was Slattery who gave it and he was killed in the fight. Against the Slatterys were the Carmodys, Learys, Butlers and Leens. The Protestants came to help the Clogher men, but were late for the fight. As the old church was desecrated by the fight it was abandoned and a new one was built at Ballydwyer. It may in fact be said that the Penal Days terminated in the parish at the whack of a blackthorn at the \"Battle of Clogher\" as I often heard the old people call it.A more remarkable faction fight was that which occurred at M\u00f3in a' Mhuil\u00ednn Co Limerick. This fight lives on in poetry which I give in the next Page.I may say that I collected this near Feale's Bridge in a district (Caher) between Feale's Bridge and Abbeyfeale in the year 1924 - with the help of Paddy McCarthy N.T.

There were two parties there.They were called the three year olds and the four year olds.Ond day the four year olds nearly killed the three year olds, and from this developed the great faction fight s known as the followers of the three year old and the four year old.  Fights were common at all meetings and at the Fair of Cluggin men and women took sides, and a man was killed.  At a mission in Nicker the leaders of both sides were brought inside the rails and old enemies were made friends.

A tragic occurrence put a stop to these fights & as far as I could gather to the fair also. A blacksmith who lived at this cross & whose brother was injured at the fair took a hammer & followed the agressors overtaking them somewhere on the road to Kilmallock. With the hammer he struck & killed a man, and a great outcry was the result. The clergy spoke against the fights & factions & this ended the business.As regards the factions I myself saw an old man said to be nearly 90 'wheeling a stick about his head and shouting out a war cry about a 'three year old'.

Sometimes one would now-a-days hear the comment \"he was a mean faction-fighter\" referring to someone who did not fight according to the rule, or who took an advantage of an opponent.About 1840 Meara (Gearailt) Shanavalla, Carrigahorig and Carroll Ballinderg, Borrisokane had a dispute and quarrel over some matter.They decided to settle the business in a fight.  The day and place were decided on - the yearly Kyleagoona Races.In those days Kyleagoon (near Borrisokane) was a famous race-course, and people from Galway, Nenagh and far off places were accustomed to come to the famous races.  People of the locality walked long distances to these races as there were no cars then not to speak of bicycles.Meara came to Kylegoona that day with his friends, and to his delight he met his opponent Carroll.  The fight began and the men fought with blackthorn sticks and loaded butts.  Meara was by far the better fighter and he gave a savage beating to Carroll, leaving him half-dead on the field.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: T\u00edr-Dh\u00e1-Ghlas (Terryglass)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Terryglass, Co.
