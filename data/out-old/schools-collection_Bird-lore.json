When it is flying it goes very and keep its beak open and catches insects which are its chief-food. When it wants a drink it skims along the top of the water in its beak. It builds its nest under the caves of houses from straw and mud with which it sticks its nest to the wall. It lays five or six white eggs with brown spots a and sits on the eggs for about three weeks. It feeds the young birds on flies and midges.

She lays her egg in the wagtails or moss-chirper's nest. When she lays her egg she takes one of the small birds eggs so that the bird will not notice her egg. Her egg is very like the moss chirpers and the wagtails only larger. It is white with brown ticks on it. Sometimes these small birds see her laying her egg and run to put her away from their nest.

Very often those nests are composed of twigs, bits of leather, rags, bones, delph and everything that is convenient for him to carry in his beak.  The thrush and blackbird build their nests in the hedges.  They are both beautiful songsters.  Those birds stay with us all the year round.The swallows come here for the Summer months and they go away again at the approach of Winter.  It is an old saying that one swallow never makes a Summer.

The birds which are commonly found in this district are the crow, wren, blackbird, thrush, crane, robin, cuckoo, swallow and corncrake.  The cuckoo, swallow and corncrake are the only birds which migrate from this country.  At the beginning of winter they go off to some of the warm countries of the South.  They come back again at the beginning of April.  The first thing they set about doing is to find a nice suitable place to make their nest.  The swallow builds her nest in an old shed on a rafter.  She gets clay and bits of grass and grips it to the rafter.  The swallow lays about four eggs.  She sits on the eggs for three weeks until the young ones come out.  When the swallows are preparing to go away they all collect on telegraph wire or on  eve tops as if they are holding a council and all face towards the South.  The cuckoo makes no nest at all.  She lays her eggs in another bird's nest.  Then the other bird hatches out the eggs.  When the young cuckoos come out the old one kills the other birds and takes the nest for herself.

Every one notices that before the swallows migrate they all gather together on the top of houses.  The yellow hammer builds her nest in a hedge and lays from three to six eggs.  Her young may  be seen anytime between April and September.  Boys who rob birds nests are naughty boys.  When we see crows flying in and out in the air it is sign of a storm.  When the swallows fly close to the ground it is a sign of rain.  There is a story about the robin and Our Saviour. When Our Saviour was dying on the cross a robin came and tried to pull the thorns out off his head.  A drop of blood fell on his breast and he is called the Robin Red Breast every since.

He is called the King of all birds ever since. The time God drowned the world Noah was a just and wise man. God told Noah that he was to drown the world and Noah built an Ark. He took seven kinds of birds into the ark. He sent out one of the birds to see was the flood gone and that bird never returned. He then chose the dove and he told her to go out to see was the flood gone and she returned with nothing in her beak. He sent her again and she returned with an olive leaf in her beak.

The wren makes a very big nest for such a tiny bird, and often lays as many as sixteen eggs in it. You will usually find the nest in a messy bank or a tree trunk. If you should touch the nest or alter the position of any part of it, the wren will never use it again.The Blackbird:-The blackbird is known by his glossy black feathers, his tawny beak, and his mellow song. He does not sing as much as the thrush. Blackbirds build their nests in all sorts of places, but usually build in a hedge or tree stump. The eggs - four or five in number often look like the eggs of the thrush.The Magpie :-The Magpie is a rather large bird. Its feathers are black and white and it also has a very long tail. Magpies live on worms and slugs. They build big nests of sticks, plastered on the inside with mud, and lined with roots and hair.

It builds a huge nest of branches at the edge of the water and it is very hostile if anyone interferes with her nest.The wild-duck also keeps near the water's edge and builds along the banks. It is a duck which resembles a domestic duck but is not so big.It is a lovely sight to see a wild duck and perhaps a dozen lovely ducklings sailing down the waters after her.

The blackbird and thrush build in the hedges, the former lays blue eggs, and the latter spotted blue eggs.The robin builds in a bank, and lays white spotted eggs. The Robin got two red breast because he stood beneath the Cross of ChristThe magpie is a robber. He goes round eating other birds' eggs. The cuckoo and the Swallow go to warm countries when winter comes.There was an old house in Drumcliffe one time and when the owner was knocking it down he came on a host of swallows fast asleep. It was said that they were not able to migrate with the older birds and so had to remain behind.Swallows flying low is a sign of bad weather; when they fly high it is a sign of good weather.When Sea Gulls come on land, weather promises bad, but if the stay on the Sea it will be good.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Rathcormac", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rathcormack, Co.

The swallow builds her nest in a barn. The cuckoo is the laziest of all the birds because she builds no nest, but lays her egg in another birds nest. It is a very unmanly thing to rob a bird's nest. It is said the birds will curse you if you do so. If the swallows fly low it is a sign of rain. The reason of this is, the flies which the swallows live on, fly down near the ground when there is a sign of rain. If the robin sings up high in a bush in the early morning it is a sign of a good day, but if she sings in the heart of a bush it is sure to rain. The robin is the bird that is liked Best by young and old on account of its red breast. The way she got the red breast was by trying to pull out the nails by which Our Lord was nailed to the cross. While trying to do so a drop of blood fell on her breast. All the birds except the robin leave us and go away to a warm country for the Winter. We see the swallows coming back to us in March.

The majority of these wild birds migrate to warmer countries when Winter is approaching here. The robin is always known to remain with us, and she is very much liked on that account.                 Each of these little birds has its own special place in which to build its nest. The robin selects a spot in a blackthorn-bush, and there makes a most attractive little nest of moss, feathers and so forth, and lines it with hair. She makes the cosiest little home of all the birds nearly. She lays about five or six eggs. her eggs are fairly small. Their colour is a kind of yellow with brown dots here and thee in them.                   The wren makes a nice little nest also.

We can notice it most, among the wild birds that inhabit our district.All birds are produced from eggs and the female bird lays those eggs. The eggs which the female bird lays is laid in a nest. All birds build their nests in the beginning of Spring. The crows, jackdaws and others build on the tree tops. The sea gull builds in the rushes in bogs. The cuckoo builds no nest, but she lays her eggs in another bird's nest. The swallows build in the eaves of houses, usually. Some of the birds come to the old nest they had the previous year, while others desert those nests and build new ones. The wild birds which mostly inhabit our district are, the crows, the wrens, robins,sea-gulls, swallows, black birds, water wagtails, wild widgeons, partridges and others.Some of our birds migrate to warm climes before the Winter sets in.

It is said that he tried to free our Lords sacred hands and feet from the cross and in the attempt his breast was stained with blood. The swallows are well kown Summer friends through they do not rank high as songsters. In the still evening you would hear their shrill call as they swoop to and from the eaves of the houses where their nests are.The swallows when flying low are said to be a sign of bad weather also if the sea-gulls fly inland. A loud strange noise is heard all through the Summer\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Cobh Labhr\u00e1is (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rerrin, Co.

When we hear the cuckoo in April that is a sign of Summer. When we see the swallows that also is a sign of Summer. From the month of March onwards they build their nests. They build their nests on fences, holes in walls and under eaves shoots and several other places. The nest is made of twigs, moss, hay, mud and feathers. The bird's eggs are different colours. The bird sits on the eggs twenty one days. When the swallows are flying high that is a sign of fine weather also when they are singing. When no sea gulls are about that is a sign of good weather because the gulls are out to sea.

The most common birds of the district are the crows gulls, and the robins. They do not go to other countries but remain around the British Isles during the whole year. Each bird builds her own nest in the first of Spring, some make it in te bushes and others on the fences. Blackbirds usually build their on the trees and robins in the fences. The crows always build their on the tops of the highest trees they can find and gulls' nest are usually built on the side of a cliff or cave. The blackbirds make theirs of sticks and hay and line them with moss and the eggs are spoted blue. The gulls' eggs are similar to the hen eggs and robin's are small white spotted eggs. Birds are hatched in less than three weeks and about a week after when their feathers are on they fly away and provide food for themselves.

They are not so plentiful in the Winter time, as they are in Summer, because many of them migrate to warmer countries.The birds that migrate are the cuckoo, swallow and the corncrake.  When the people hear the cuckoo calling they are sure that summer has arrived.  The cuckoo does not build a nest of her own but lays her eggs in another bird's nest.  The eggs are hatched and a young cuckoo comes out.  Sometimes a cuckoo is seen with two small birds following it.  The reason for this is because she has probably laid her egg in that little bird's nest and so with the male bird she chases the cuckoo.The swallow builds her nest inside in a cow-house, or on the eave of a house.  She builds it with mud and lines it with feathers.  When the swallow flies high in the air it is a sign that the flies which it is feeding on are up there.  The flies are up high, because the air is warmer there than down near the ground, and so it is a sign of fine weather.

She makes her nest of fried grass, with lots of paper, feathers and bits of hair woven together. She lays about four eggs and these are white with dark markings. This bird is called the House Sparrour.The Hedge Sparrour belongs to the family of warblers. This bird builds its nest in a thick bush. This is a beautiful bird of steel-grey and brown plumage. It lived almost entirely upon insets and builds and lovely moss nest. The eggs are of a delicate pale blue colour.Rooks build their nest close together in tall trees. They place their nests at the end of some of the thinnest branches to ensure preservation from nest-robbers. This is called a \"Rookery\". Early in Spring the Rooks mend their nests which are made of sticks, dried grass and feathers to make them comfortable. Mother Rook lays four pale blue eggs with dark markings. The parent birds are strong and fearless with glossy blue-feathers and strong hard bills and claws. When calling the Rook says \"baur, baur\" The space between the eyes in the Rooks is bare but the brows which belong to the same family have this part covered with bristly feathers.

People say they are planning their journey to another country. In my district birds build their nests in hedges, shrubs, bushes, holes in walls, in the roofs of sheds, in the eaves of houses and in treetops. Chaffinches build pretty little round nests made of moss, lichen, hay and hair and lined with soft feathers on the inside. Sparrows build their nests in shrubs and bushes. The nests are made of twigs, hay and hair. The eggs are deep blue. Blackbirds build round nests out of twigs, moss, hay, hair and feathers. The eggs are of a light blue colour with brown spots on them, thrushes eggs are of nearly the same colour. The birds sit on the eggs for three weeks.

These birds generally build their nests in under the roof of an old barn or shed, and in cow-houses. The cuckoo flies away in July. She builds a nest, but usually lays her egg on the ground then takes it up in her bill and deposits it in the nest of an insect-feeder, such as the hedge-sparrow, or pud(?) wagtail. Sometimes small birds mistake the cuckoo for a hawk, and they gather around to mob her. Blackbirds and thrushes build their nests in bushes. They make them of sticks, mud, moss, and hair, and the eggs take three weeks to hatch. It may be remarked here that the cuckoo's egg takes only a fortnight to hatch out. the robin and the wren both build their nest on the sheltered side of an earthen fence.

In Summer the cuckoo the corncrake and the swallow come to this country and they are to be seen and heard during the fine warm days. The blackbird and thrush build their nests in a thick hedgerow or in a messy bank and very often beside a brook. The swallows build their nests in the eaves of houses and in the roofs of cow-houses. They are made of hair and mud and your after year the swallow returns to the nest she made the previous year where she lays her eggs and hatches out her young. An old saying is \"if you rob a swallow's nest the cows will milk blood\" The robin's carefully woven nest of hair and moss is found in a bush or in an old wall, and the lark's is found in a meadow or field of corn. Deep in the prickly shelter of a gorse bush is the place to find the nest of a chaffinch. Other birds that are commonly known in this district are the magpie and the wood-quest or ring dove. The magpie builds a large nest of sticks lined with hair having only a small hole in the side of it for the bird to pass through. The wood-quest's nest is built in a tall tree with merely sticks left across each other. She always lays two eggs and very often they are blown from the nest by the wind. It is believed that when Our Lord was dying, a robin stood at the foot of the cross on which He was nailed, and a drop of this blood fell on the robin's breast and coloured it, ever since it has been bee known as robin-red-breast.

Thrush, Blackbird, Robin, Wren, Lark, Plover, Starling, Linnet, Lady-wagtail, Yellow-hammer, King-fisher, Curlew, Jack-daw, Rook, Magpie, etc.There are two classes of thrush viz. the garden trush and the rock-thrush. The garden thrush builds her nest in a tree, and the rock-thrush builds her nest on the edges of rocks. The thrush lays about four or five eggs. The eggs are white but are spotted all over with small brown spots. The mother bird sits on the eggs for three weeks before the young birds come out. When the young birds come out the mother bird goes away to find worms, which she rears the young birds with. The birds grow and after a couple of months they are able to provide for themselves.

All the birds make their nests of clay, moss, feathers and [saps of hap] but the crow uses sticks only. Every birds nest is of saucer shape but being deeper than a saucer except the wren's his nest is covered all over with a little hole in one side, for him to go in and out. I never saw a swallow's egg's, or sparrow's eggs or larks eggs. A robins eggs are white with brown spots, the thrushes eggs are the same as the robins but being bigger.
