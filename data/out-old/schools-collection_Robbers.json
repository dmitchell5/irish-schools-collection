Often times they fought amongst themselves over the division of the booty. The clothes of murdered men were often seen on the men of this village. No man or property was safe except where 4 or 5 houses stood close. Pollock an English settler who lived convenient to Ballinasloe got a large tract of land in the [?] of Glinsk + Kilbeg met.

One of Kirby was a tailor and near the site of his house there is a whitethorn bush still growing. This is known as the \"Tailor's Bush\".One morning as Kirby was crossing through fields belonging to ? Ryan, Foilaclera near the cross of Foilaclera (or Nanny's Cross), he noticed strange horses in Ryan's field. He must have been a good scout because he noticed the horses and also noticed they were looking around as if startled or at least as if something unusual were happening. He became suspicious & kept a sharp look out. He soon saw a considerable force of policemen lying in wait for him. Some were in suitable outfit for running - one in particular was so - Kirby commenced to run and the policeman pursued him. He faced for a deep narrow \"valley\" at one side of the field. Kirby jumped clean over the valley. The\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Faill U\u00ed Chl\u00e9irigh", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Foilycleara, Co.

He was very clever. When ever he would think the guards would be after him he would turn the shoes backwards on his horse and gallop off. The guards would think they would catch him but they were going farther from him and that is why they could not catch him for a long time.He had a den made in Mr O'Brien's wood. He never lived any place but he had dens made so as he could hide from the guards. If he ever saw the guards comiing he would get off his horse and go into a den that the guards didn't know about.He often took money from rich people and gave it to the poor. A certain woman could not get the money to pay her rent. He robbed a rich man and gave her the money. When he was going to rob the man he got a cabbage stalk and let on it was a revolver he had.
