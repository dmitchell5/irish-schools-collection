They sailed uneventfully down the Shannon until they reached Ballyclogher when suddenly a squall struck the boat and turned her up-set down throwing the two occupants into the water. The boy swam for the shore expecting his father, who was a good swimmer, to do the same but he saw no sign of him in any direction. He went for help to the local people who lived near the river and those put off in a boat to the rescue. When they reached the sunken boat and righted it they found the man drowned being caught by the ropes and sail and unable to extricate himself before he drowned.
