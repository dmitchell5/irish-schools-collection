This tick was called the \"Death watch\". The old people used to say that a sure sign of death was to see a sick person throwing the clothes down off him. When a dog was heard crying in the night time it was a death warning to any sick person in the village. The crying of the banshee was a death warning. An image called \"Colann gan Ceann\" used to be seen, and the person who saw it, died soon after. To hear a hen crowing is also a sign of death. If a leather bat took a rib out of a persons head when flying over him, that person would die soon after. It is not right to throw out dust or ashes in a house where there is a corpse. When a person dies in a house, it is right to stop the clock. People should wash all the clothes in the bed or in the room where a corpse was. Even toilet covers, the table-cloths, etc. should be at least wet.

The story is that at the day of Judgment all will have to gather up each nib of hair that grew on their heads during life and that if it is burned their task will be impossible. 3. Some men will not shave on a Sunday. This is because of a promise they have made as a cure for toothache. 4. It is usual to wish a person who has got any new garment \"health to wear\".

It was an old bog pass at one time and it went straight from Glenmore to Augher and Clogher. It was older than the broad road which is used now instead of the Drumfurrer one on the Glen road as we call it. There is a bridge on it which was built sixty years ago across a little river running from Killabern Lough. A good many people are afraid to go past it at a late hour of the night as the people say there is a ghost at it. From the time of the famine in 1847, old people say there was a hungry man coming along the road and the only thing he could get was beans and he ate too much and died at this bridge before it was built.Since the people call it \"Planksty\". As the same man that died was of that name. It must be a very old road because William Carleton the famous writer mentioned it in his story writing. He used to travel this road going from Clogher where he was born, to friends of his in Deragola, called McCarrons.

Even though it makes much noise at night the people would not touch it.3. A rat is a very unlucky animal.  If rats come into a house it's a sure sign of a death.4. The cockroach is an insect very much hated and everyone loves to kill him.  Everybody that kills one says \"That is seven sins of my soul\".5. The swan is supposed to be a \"gentle bird\", and if you kill a swan you are sure to have bad luck.6. The \"boortree is\" a very unlucky tree.  The people would not let it into the house to be burned.  The reason for this is because Judas was supposed to hang himself on it.7.  The hawthorn bush is supposed to be unlucky.  It would not be let into the house, and if it does happen to get into the house you will have bad luck.8. The magpie is a very unlucky bird and he is always watched to be shot.

Long ago before the parrfin oil came to the country the people made their own light with rushes and rozen. Other old habbits were when a person would get married they would go to some town. When they would come home again the groom would break a bottle on a stone. If the glass would spread out he would not have much luck. Then the bride would be going in to the house some one would break a cake of break on her head. Other habits were when a child would be born the people would put a shamrock in its mouth. Then they say that the child could sing.\n\n\n\nSchool gamesThe school games of to day are far different from those long ago.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Tappa", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Tetoppa, Co.

He began to sow the seed, and when he came to the end of the field, he turned back, and had quite enough for another sowing. He was surprised to find the oats went so far, and when he came to the sack to refill, the amount in it seemed not to be lessened.  He continued on and every time he came to the sack to fill his apron, he found the sack to be as full as it was that morning, though the widow brought no more out from the house.The old man said that this was a case of pure witchcraft.

That knot must not dare be loosed until all the corn is sown and if he is sowing hay seed later on the sheet will be preserved with the knot intact until then. If by any mischance the knot became unloosed in the meantime he would sow no hayseed that year. When a cow was about to calve a sprig of palm would be tied to her horns and a blessed candle lighted in the shed. When young calves would be driven out to grass for the first time pieces of ribbon would be tied on their tails.

A red piece of string is tied to a calf's leg as a prevention from sickness.   Before starting a churning \"the sign of the Cross\" is made with a pinch of salt over the milk.    A casual 'rambler' would not be allowed to leave the house while a churning was on, without giving a few 'brashes' with the dash to the milk. It is believed that if he left without doing so, he would bring the butter with him.

There are roars of laughter at each story told, and sometimes to make the night more enjoyable, the kind lady of the house makes tea, and hands it round to the \"ramblers\" with a substantial slice of bread, home made bread. In some houses tea is not given to the ramblers, but whether tea is given or not, the same boys from the district ramble to the same house. Everyone in the district frequents the rambling house.

(all souls eve.) before going to bed the hearth is swept, a good fire is put on, and bread (oat-meal bread when it used to be made) and water is left on a table for the souls in Purgatory. The door is left on the latch on this night also.Before a newly calved cow is milked, a horse-stump is reddened in the fire; some burning coals or turf are put in an old tin porringer + red-hot horse stump is put into it. (The hot coals are to keep the stump warm). The porringer is then taken out to the byre + three \"straws\" of milk of milk are drawn from each teat into the tin. When this is done the coals are emptied in the group behind the cow.The people were very superstitious as regards the first person they meet when on their way to the fair or market, particularly if they had anything to sell.
