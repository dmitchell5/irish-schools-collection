Every farmer had an ass & cart or a horse & cart on the road during the Summer months drawing lime stone.  The stones had to be broken to about the size of coarse gravel and this was done during the Winter months.    The kiln was usually prepared for burning in early Spring. First of all turf was placed in the bottom to a depth of three or four feet, then a layer of broken stones were placed on top of the turf. Alternate layers of broken limestone and turf were added until the kiln was filled up to the top (in later years \"culm\" instead of turf was used between the layers of broken limestone, but the turf always had to be used in the bottom of the kiln in order to start the fire)\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Leggah, Moyne", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Leggagh, Co.

The owners raised the stone themselves and some of them had to employ labourers at 2d a day to assist them. The stones were piled in heaps at the quarries and sold at 1/ a load to people who needed it.There was a lime kiln on every farm around here - even on a five acre farm. The lime was burned principally for top dressing and it was mixed with bog stuff and stuff taken out of drains. The heap was mixed in early winter and put out on the land in Spring and Mr John Kiernan told me that the old people believed that there was no manure any good without a mixture of lime. Of all these kilns and quarries there is only one kiln in Mullinroe that burns lime now but there is scarcely a farm in the district but has a field called \"the Lime Kiln field\" although in most cases there is no trace of the old kiln.

This accomplised, the next thing to be done is to get a plentiful supply of coke and bushes. You put the bushes in first, then the coke on top of that, and the limestone on top of the coke. Then the bushes are set on fire, and after a while the coke starts to light. The kiln (the name used for the hole in the ground) is then covered over with galvanised iron. It is then left to burn for a few days. Every morning the owner of kiln comes and puts more fuel and limestone into it. After three days burning the fire is then let go out.

It is in the middle of a fertile district, in the townland of Kilnahone. The kiln was started about 18 yrs. ago, by shareholders of the Ballygarvan Farmer's Union of whom Mr. Love Ballea was Treasurer. It was he who sold the lime and paid the men. The kiln worked well for some time, and did a good trade. When the price of Agricultural Produce fell, and the price of lime got so high, it would not pay the farmers to manure the land with it. So it closed down.   The limestone was quarried in the local quarries, and was carted to the kiln. The stone was laid in layers of limestone and culm (a black substance like coal used in burning lime) The kiln was filled to the top; set fire to at the bottom and kept burning for 3 days. According as the stone was burned the lime fell down through a sort of crater. The lime was then sold at about 7s 6d a barrel or less according the the price of culm and the labour producing it.
