Whenever a person was unusually ill or in danger of death someone used to go to Biddy looking for a cure.  She would look through a bottle & tell them whether the person would recover or not and tell them what to do & sometimes she told the person who came to them that the patient would be dead when the person would go home.  People used to say that when a person died young & when doctors couldn't cure them that it was the good people (dead people) used to take them & that Biddy was a kind of intercessor for them. \"Oh twas taken he was\" was the comment when such a sick person died.\n", "school_info": "School: Cathair Loisgre\u00e1in (B)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Caherlustraun, Co.
