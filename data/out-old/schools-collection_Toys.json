They can also cut the pulp out of the turnips and put candles lighting into it.My mother when she was small used to make a whistle from a tall herb called a kice.  She cut a hole in it and put a piece of wood inside fora tongue and six holes to work her fingers on to make it whistle.Another toy she made was to root a briar and dress the root of it and make a pipe of it.  She had to scoop the root of the briar and make it the shape of the head of a pipe and get and ash stick and pare it for the shank and it makes a lovely pipe.Another old toy was Crow Mill made out of a piece of tin and a hole in the centre of it.  She stuck a hole in the ground and the wind would whirl it up an down.The girls make necklaces from daisies when they are in bloom.  They also make dolls.  This is how to make them.  Take some wool and wind it round your hand till it is thick enough to make the dolls body.  Slip it off your hand and tie a piece of wool around it about half an inch down.

First I got some coloured cloth and hay. I cut out the shape of the doll's feet, hands body and head in the cloth. Then I sewed them up and stuffed them with hay. Next I sewed the feet and hands on to the body. From two round pieces of cloth I made the head. For the face I sewed on a piece of white cardboard, marked on it in black pencil two dots for eyes, a dot for a nose, a long line for the mouth, slanted strokes over the eye for eyebrows.

A tiny piece of raw potato is placed and one end of the outer stick and shoved down to the mouth. A second piece of the potato is left at the opening. The handle is pushed through, the pressure then exerted on the air between the two pieces of potato causes the first to shoot out making the \"pop\" noise children love so well. Sometimes they shoot water from the pop-gun. This they do by tying a piece of woollen thread on to the handle and soaking it in water.

A piece of (wool) wood is inserted in the middle for a seat. A hole is bored in it with a hot poker and a stick is stuck in for a mast. Stones are then but in to balance it. Another type of boat, though much simpler made, is the cork boat. For this a cork and a feather are needed. The feather is stuck in the cork and in a windy day it sails like a yacht.There are many ways of making fishing lines but the crab line is the most common. To make it a length of cord, a sinker and some bait are needed. The neck of a bottle or a stone is substituted for the sinker and barnacles for the bait. The barnacles grow on rocks and are hammered off with a stone and threaded on to the cord. The bait is tied to the bottom of the line and the sinker is tied about a foot above.Another sort of line is made to catch trout!\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Rathmullan", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rathmullan, Co.

When he had that finished he got scollops and pointed them.  He put the pointed end on the stick and the other end against the thong.  Then he pulled the thong and let it go again.  The force of the thong going back into it's place sent the stick up into the air with great speed. Another toy which was made at that time was a flute.  He got a long piece of an elder stick and burned the pith out of it with a red hot iron. Then he put six holes in it for the fingers and one big one to blow into.

It is easy to make one, but it requires a clever boy to make a really strong crib.  Sally rods are the best, as they are soft and easily bent, without breaking.  The first job is to make the frame.  It get four strong pieces and join them so as to form a square.  The size of which will depend on the size of the cradle required.  They are joined by a piece of thick wire.  Strong cords go from corner to corner and the whole is built up by short pieces of sally, fitted along the four sides under the cords.  It is narrow on top. Next comes a bow of sally.  The machine when set, rests on a gallog.  Which is a short piece of cleft stick.  This is under the crib and is connected with the bow.The little bird steps on the bow when coming in for food.  The gallog steps and down the cage falls, keeping the bird inside.  It is interesting to see the bird running all round looking for an opening to get out.  There is of course no need to take the poor birds life.  She may be set free again.Girls in Summer make daisy chains.  They string them on to a piece of thread or girdle.  They can also stuff dolls into shape with saw dust or straw. Then they cover this saw dust or straw with cloths, and they also sew in two coloured buttons for eyes.

If the striker tangles, the other boy gets three free strokes at his nut.Some boys season nuts as they hang them up on the chimney and leave them there until the year after. A nut of the previous year is better than a fresh one. It would break more nuts than a fresh one would.

With these a Stone called a granny would be wanted. Then a partner in the game would put the cat sitting on the granny and with a blow of the dog the cat would be sent right up in the air; if the opposite partner can catch the cat flying, the man who is playing is knocked out. If the cat is not caught then the playing man with the dog in his hand tips the cat on the pointed ends three times and drives it as far from the granny as possible.

One of the things they used to make were dolls out of wood.  They also made dolls out of cloth.  They called these dolls rag dolls. They made spinning tops out of a piece of wood.They also made guns out of a stick of an elder bush.  They would push the inside of these sticks out, then they would get two pieces of paper and chew them and put one at each end of the stick. Then they would squeeze the two pieces of paper together and leave the air inside no room. Then the air inside would let a shot.They called these guns pot-guns. They also made cups, saucers, plates and mugs out of wood. The mugs they made they called them noggins.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Skryne", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Skreen, Co.

The first favourite among boys is a gun. This is made by sawing the top of an old bicycle pump. A cork is then placed in the sawed end and when the handle is pulled up and down the cork shoots out just as effectively as the most expensive gun bought. Another favourite among boys is the caterpillar spool. This is made by pulling a thin rubber band through an empty spool. Place a piece of match through one end of the rubber. Then hammer a small tack through the same end of the spool so that the piece of match cannot turn while the spool is being wound. A hole is then made in a small piece of candle and the rubber pulled through it. Also put a whole match through the end of the rubber and twist until quite tight.  Place on the floor and it will across with a caterpillar motion. Nearly every boy known how to make an aerial bomb. For this an empty carbide tin is needed.

A long string or cord is then nailed to the middle of the kite. Buntings can be tied to the middle, or to the end of the kite to make it float more steadily.A pop-gun is another toy made by the boys of this district. The pop-gun comprises a barrel, a ram-rod and two corks. The barrel which is usually 9\" long, is made from a piece of elder with a hole bored through it. The ram-rod can be made from any hard wood. It must be eleven inches long - three inches for a handle and eight inches to run through the barrel. Cork should be half an inch long. The gun is now ready for use. The corks are now placed in each end of the barrel. The ram-rod is then pushed through.
