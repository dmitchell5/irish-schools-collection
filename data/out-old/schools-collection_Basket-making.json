In fact a donkey and \"bardogs\" were often the only means of transport on some of the poorest holdings.The bardogs consisted of two wooden boxes about 20\" by 18\" by 15\" slung one on each side across a donkey's back.  On the donkey was a wooden straddle with a straw net about 2\" thick underneath and from a peg on each side of the straddle the 'bardogs' were suspended.  Each bardog had a hinged bottom which could be easily opened thus depositing the contents on the ground.  Straddles and nets were sold on the street at fairs and markets in the towns of Carrickmacross & Castleblayney.  The bardogs, the construction of which require little or no skill were usually made by the farmer himself.The stigma of poverty and lowliness was not infrequently associated with bardogs, as a poem by Art McCooey exemplifies.

When they wanted to make a basket they would pull all the rods that grew in the garden and rods that grew in many other places. When the rods were pulled they would take the cover off them and boil them and then make baskets with them. The way they made the baskets was to get six strong rods and fasten them together and then weave thin rods around them and that was floor of the basket then a bout forty strong rods were fastened to the side of the floor of basket.

This man used to supply for the moderate price of 1s and 1s - 6d most of the people of the parish of Kilglass with creels and baskets made from sally rods.This is how a basket was made. The thick stem of a buckie briar was cut and placed before the fire or left standing until it was pliable. Then it was made into a round hoop and both ends were tied together. A second strong briar called a rib was run across in the centre and bent down at each end so as to make it deep. Then each end was fastened securely to the hoop.

First about 40 rods are stuck down into the ground and shaped into a square or oblong, and every pair of rods is put close together.  Then the creel is started on the ground and worked up.

Then take off the twine and twist the standards from all sides to form the bottom. Then take the basket off of the tub and bend them down into the binding. Then take four rods and heat them over a fire. Then put one rod down at the right-hand side and another at the left-hand side. Then plat them together to form a handle.
