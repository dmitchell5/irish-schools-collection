One of these is situated in the townland of Foiberg.  It is built on a high hillock overlooking Bantry Bay and Dunmanus Bay.  There is the form of a old wall and the pillars of gates around it.  In front of the ruin a huge stone marks a grave in which a soldier is buried.     At that time the soldiers were removed from one tower to another after the space of a few months.  The soldiers from this tower had to go to Bantry when the removal took place.  On one of these occasions the soldiers were marching to Bantry.  Near Ahakista they met a boy driving cattle.  They passed on but had gone only about one hundred yards when the boy   began to shout.  The soldiers instantly turned round and shot the youth.  T When the French fleet came into Bantry Bay and were dispersed by storms one of the ships the \"Patiente\" went down outside of Turreen which is at the western end of this point.     The Fianna are also connected with this district. The highest hill in this peninsula is Suide Fionn.  On this hill Fionn Mac Cumhall and his army are said to have camped.  Forts built by the natives of this locality at the time of the Danes tell us that this district is connected with the Danes.  These forts were erected by the people so as to safe-guard themselves from the onslaughts of the Invaders.

It received its name from a great massacre held there years ago.The English invited the people of the neighbouring places to go to a meeting which was being held at the rath in order to make terms of peace and to lay down their arms. All the Irish people suspecting no danger came there. When they were all inside the rath and had laid down their arms the English soldiers turned on them and killed most of them on the spot. The people who escaped turned towards the north but they were followed by their English opponents and at a valley about half a mile from the rath about three hundred more were killed, and that valley has been since called by the people of the locality \u201cThe Murdering Hollow\u201d.At the time of the Anglo Irish war 1819 the name Gibbeth rath camp was painted over one of the camps which was kept for Internment but when the English officers heard of how the rath got its name the word \u201cGibbet\u201d was painted over and it was called \u201cRath Camp\u201d.\n", "school_info": "School: Scoil na mBr\u00e1thar, Mainistir na Corann", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Midleton, Co.
