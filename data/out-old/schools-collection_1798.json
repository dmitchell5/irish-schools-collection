In the year 1798 a small crowd of pipers used to go to Cockles Bridge. One night they were playing on the pipes when a man came galloping up on a horse. The sweat was rolling off the man and the horse. He stopped and said to the pipers, \"Oh those cursed English\" they have chased me miles and miles. The pipers pitied him and gave him hospitality all except McEvoy. But James McEvoy said he was afraid he was a spy. They laughed and ridiculed him. For more than a week James McEvoy watched Vivela carefully. One day McEvoy saw him riding away from Naul. He followed him and said he would kill him if he did not tell him where he was going. Vivela confessed that he was going to England, so he killed him at the pipers' hole. Vivela wore a leather breeches with a patch on it. McEvoy put it on him. The soldier arrested him for killing Vivela and when McEvoy was been [sic] tried he made a breeches exactly the same.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Naul", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Naul, Co.

He was taken prisoner and one story-teller says he escaped en route to prison. From the prison van he escaped and boarded a load of hay at Maynooth and got over walls of Duke of Leinsters Estate. At this time the Harbenton family had a Mrs. Grattan and daughter employed. The rebels raided Newbury Hall and these resisted and were killed by raiders and put into Newbury Pond. The crime was denounced by Parish Priest who said the culprit or culprits would be brought to justice before a year and a day and they were.Kilmurray was one of them.

The insurgents in Monasterevan found a leader in one of their priests,  Father Prendergast.They attacked the yeomen under Captain Cassidy, but suffered defeat and their brave leader fell into the hands of the yeomen.  He was sentenced to be hanged by the order of Captain Cassidy.  Tradition has it that the yeomen asked Captain Cassidy what they were to do with the Papist Priest.  He replied, \"Take him out and hang him\".  But Captain Cassidy choked while uttering the death sentence of this brave Priest.  So Father Prendergast suffered the fate of many another brave Irishman. He was hanged from a tree in the centre of the town and from that day the tree withered and all that remains today is a stump.The people of the town revered the body of that patriotic Priest and when night fell they conveyed it by boat to Harristown, where they buried it.\n", "school_info": "School: Mercy Convent, Monasterevan", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Monasterevin, Co.

Still however, he may have sympathised with the United Irishmen, he was not a member of that body.Accounts of the foul murder.  He was asked by a cousin of his named Carroll to baptise a child at Aadenstown where his presence was availed of to hear the confessions of the United Irishmen in camp Barnkill, which he did under a hedge.

Travelling tinkers in Old Leighlin in '98 having an anvil in their outfit were employed by the local United Irishmen to make pikes a short time before Father Murphy's army marched on Comer. The tradition is that those tinkers getting some inkling of intended attack on Comer made the pikes but gave information to the Protestant Bishop (Vigors) who lived at Burgage.  He hastened to Kilkenny and told the military there who were then forewarned of the contemplated attack.As a reward for their betrayal this family were given a house and land in Old Leighlin by the Bishop, where their descendants still reside.
