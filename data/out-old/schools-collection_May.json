The evening previous to May-day some member of each household goes out into the fields and gathers a hugh  quantity of May-flowers. In the towns some poor children go about selling flowers for a little money. On that night, they are scattered on the door-steps and on the window-sills, to welcome the first day of Summer. As the month of May is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, an altar is prepared in every Catholic home. It is decorated with flowers, and a small lighted lamp is placed before her statue. Long ago it was customary not to put out the ashes, or sweep the floor on May-day. The old people never gave away milk, as they believed they would have no butter on the next churning. Many girls went out into a field at break of day and washed their faces in the dew, under a hawthorn tree. It was said that such people did not get sun-burned during the following Summer. Other customs practised were, the placing of a branch of the mountain-ash in a manure heap in order to protect the cows, and the placing of a \"griosach\" under a churn so that the\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Abbeytown Convent N.S.", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Boyle, Co.

The first and most important of those old Irish customs, was the scattering of May-flowers on the threshold. Long, long ago before the Light of Christianity brightened this once-pagan land of ours our forefathers believed, that in each woodland flower, there lived a tiny fairy who could throw a spell of enchantment on any person who held it. The May-flowers were supposed to be the tiny golden mansions of Good Luck. The reason then for scattering the flowers on each doorstep is that the inhabitants of the fairy mansions may shower an abundance of good-luck on the entire household. Another reason was to save them from the witchcraft of the \"cailleachs\" or the old hags who were supposed to go from house to house on May-morning stealing butter and milk from the churns.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Abbeytown Convent N.S.", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Boyle, Co.

One year her cows yielded very poor milk which had no cream. She was very much surprised as her cows always had good rich milk. Her father who was very old said that maybe some neighbour milked the cows on May morning of the preceding year. She promised that she would watch her cows on the following May morning. She kept her promise and went to the field of the cows. She took a dog with her. She entered the field and concealed herself behind a lump of sillies. She was not long waiting when a neighbouring woman came and put a \"spancel\" under one of the cows. She then started milking but had no bucket.
