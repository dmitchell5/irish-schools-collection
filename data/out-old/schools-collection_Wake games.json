The seven daughters was a game where all locked arms and everyone had a \"sugar\" covered rod. The seven had to go out through the door and two men were behind the door beating them and preventing their getting out. If any spite existed the game became venomous and often resulted in quarreling.\"Ratha\" was played with a leather strap. These games were not very polite. Mock courts were also held and evidence etc. given. Mock marriages were also common.The clock in a corpse house was always stopped and the bed, chairs, etc. were turned over when the corpse left the house. A cat was not allowed into the corpse room.
