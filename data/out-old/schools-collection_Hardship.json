At the time this boat capsized they were far from Inver and on that account there was no boat within easy reach to aid them.This crew were fishermen from Inver and Fanaghan, their names being: Peter Kennedy and his son Patrick, John Gallagher, John Mc Sweeney, two Browns and Charles Keeney. It was by the sea that these men earned their living.In the year 1871, there was a house in Drimlatafin burned. This house belonged to a man by the name of Gallagher. This occurred when they were sleeping in the house, but they escaped uninjured, the roof and woodwork being only burned.About sixty years ago the people of this area were stricken with a disease called the small-pox, because they used never get vaccinated. When the people would have the pox if they wouldn't get the right treatment, they would become all marked and some of the people who had it are living still. About twenty years ago ago they were stricken with a disease known as influenza. Both diseases were very infectious. Nearly all the small children who were living that time had the small-pox. Many people died of influenza. There died a Gallagher girl in Drimlatafin with influenza.Collected by: Annie Teresa Boyle,Drimlatafin,\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: An Cill\u00edn", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Killin, Co.

It was the time of the jews and the priest was hiding from the jews.  The priest was saying Mass.  And there were people there along with the priest.  One time the jews were looking for the priest and they saw the old cave and they said to one another that they would go in and see what was inside.  So they went inside and saw the priest saying Mass.  And they raised their spears on high and they slashed the people down like dirt and also the priest.  The same jews went along the road and they saw a church.  And they set the church on fire.

One day Jaafe came in to \"Padlow\" (Paddy Dondican) for the loan of a couple of bags. Paddy Doudican said if he gave them he might not get them back soon enough.

Those provinces are divided into counties and every county consists of a number of parishes. In almost every parish in Ireland there is some history relating to events that happened in bygone days. Long ago St. Patrick erected many monasteries and churches in Ireland. Those monasteries were ruled by monks and Ireland was a very christian country at this time. I live in the parish of Bunninadden but I come to school in Achonry. Achonry is a very nice parish. It has one school one Catholic church, one Protestant church and a Holy Well. Close to this Holy Well and to the Protestant church are the ruins of an old monastery. We learn from history that when the Danes came to Ireland they killed many monks and burned their monasteries. We are told that this monastery in Achonry was distroyed by the Danes. One day when the Danes were going through the country they came to this monastery and at once attacked the monks. Some of them fled at sight of the soldiers, but they shot an old priest and buried him on a hill close to the monastery. They erected a cross over his grave and that cross is still to be seen. It is a very remarkable grave as no grass ever grew over it.\n", "school_info": "School: Achadh Conaire", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Achonry, Co. Sligo", "Teacher:": "\nT.

The train for Cavan, which leaves Clones about half-past nine, was delayed accordingly.  When about one and a half miles outside Clones, one of the connecting rods of the engine broke, the loose end flew round penetrating the fire-box, where the water tubes are situated, shattered them, and allowed the steam to escape into the fire-box.  At the same time the fireman was in the act of stoking the engine.  The rush of steam from the broken tubes coming through the fire-box door, combined with hot cinders and ashes enveloped the fireman and inflicted severe burns.  The driver was also scalded.  The train ran for a short distance and automatically came to a standstill.  After a short time a doctor was informed and help was brought on the scene.  First-aid was rendered to the fireman and driver, who were afterwards conveyed to Cavan Hospital  The disabled engine was towed back to Clones, and a relief train brought the passengers to their destination at a very late hour.

There was always great danger of the flax bursting into flames when the fire was strong.  One time there was a farmer in Glangevlin named James Fleming drying flax in a barn beside the dwelling house.  On this day the wind was blowing strongly.

The castle was progressively (?) in strength, and so important was it regarded by the English monarchs, that when Henry III granted the dominion of Ireland to his son (Prince Edward) this town was expressly reserved with other principal cities; and when the same monarch granted the whole of Connaught to Richard De Burgo, he retained for himself five cantseds (?) contiguous to the Castle.\"In 1224 another monastery was founded on the eastern side of the Shannon by Cathal Crob Dearg O'Connor, Prince (correctly King) of Connaught and completed by Sir Henry Dillon who was interred in it in 1244. In the reign of Elizabeth the fortifications were strengthened  and the castle was for some time occupied by the Earl of Essex. The Castle became the seat of the (English) presidency of Connaught, and when the insurrection broke out, in 1641, it was occupied by Viscount Ranelagh, then lord-president, with the usual ward of a royal castle.\"After the victories obtained by Cromwell, the castle   was taken on a second attack by Sir Charles Coote for the Parliament; and during the fury of the war the town was burned. Though subsequently restored it never recovered its former strength or appearance; and in the reign of Charles II. the eastern portion of it was destroyed  by an accidental fire. The English, on taking possession of the town, immediately directed their attention to its restoration and to the repair of its fortifications and works; and it soon became one of the principal military depots for arms, stores, and ammunition.\n\n\n\nDisastrous Explosion\"On the 27th October, 1697, the Castle was, during one of the severest (thunder) storms ever known here, struck by the electric fluid, which set fire to the magazine, in which were 260 barrels of gunpowder, 10,000 hand grenades, charged, and a great quantity of match and other combustible stores, the whole of which exploded with so violent a concussion that all the houses in the town, except a few cottages without the gates, were shattered or destroyed; the loss of life, however, was comparatively small, only seven persons being killed and thirty-six wounded. \"The town, though at present (1837) the largest on the Shannon next to Limerick, still retains much of its character as a military station. On the Leinster side, one of the principal entrances near the river is through a gateway (passing through) one of the old square towers; and the ancient walls, though in great measure concealed by buildings, extend for a considerable distance in that direction (East and S. East on the Westmeath side). On the Connaught side there are scarcely any traces of the walls of gate; but in this quarter are situated all the present millitary defences of the place.\"There consist principally of the Castle which forms a tete du pont (bridgehead), and of advanced forts and redoubts on the outside of the town to defend the main approaches along the great road from Galway by Ballinasloe, the most important line of communication with that part of the country, which is most exposed to invasion.\"A short canal on this side of the river enables boats navigating the Shannon (in 1837) to avoid the rapids at the bridge of Athlone, and add materially to the strength of the works; it is crossed by three bridges, one of which is falling into decay, and of which two are defended by pallisades, those of the third having been taken down to facilitate the passing of the mail coaches. The bogs along the river are a sufficient protection to the town on the south side.\n", "school_info": "School: Christian Brothers, Athlone", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Athlone, Co.

One of them John was married to a woman from Rivelchapel close to Courtown Harbour and about ten miles from Ballyart She owned the house and a bit of land and John Byrne went in as a 'cluain isceai'But Mrs. Byrne refused to sgn over the place to her husband and this led to quarrels and finally seperation John Byrne coming back to Ballyart to live with his people.

A thatched house which belonged to Mr. Withers took fire.  It happened in the summer time while the whole family were in the meadow making hay.Two roadmen, Mr. P. Flynn and Mr. P. Collins saw the roof burning. Then they ran down to the meadow and some other neighbours came and extinguished the fire.  Afterwards a new roof was put on the house, and it is now a slated one.About three miles from Liscarroll a man was drowned in the river near Freemount.  He was from Dromina.  His name was Mr. John Walshe.  There was on many with him but he could to save him.A few miles from here there is a village called Churchtown.  It was burned in the year 1822 by the \"Whiteboys\".  All the houses were thatched but now they are all slated. In Dromcollogher there was a great burning and there were many lives lost.  There was a plague of fever in the parish about forty years ago.

All things necessary for building were got and in a few days the work of the building was begun.After a few months when the house was nearly completed the nurse took the little boy up to see it.He was delighted at being brought out and ran around all day all the men taking care of him along with the nurse.
