He built his castle there.  He killed and ate the people's animals.  He left a lighted candle outside his door every night, and every person who looked at the candle would die before morning.  A young man named Regan sat out one night to kill the monster.  He put on a magic cap that shaded his eyes from the candle.  He found the candle blindfolded and threw it into the Shannon.  Then the cap fell from his eyes.  The giant ran out and Regan, who was six feet in height, was only up to his knee.  Regan struck the giant with his sword, but the giant's skin was so tough that it broke Regan's sword.  The giant paused for a moment after receiving the blow.  While Regan had a chance he dived into the Shannon and swam across.  The giant picked up a bit of the cliff about two tons weight, and threw it at Regan.  As he did so he slipped and fell over the cliff.  The stone fell on him and killed him.Once a king lived in the North of Ireland.  He had only one daughter whom he wished to get married.

The sea ebbs completely around this stone at Templetown at Spring tides. Tradition has it that in olden days two giants, one at Templetown and the other on the hills over Rostrevor commenced throwing stones at each other - actually a distance of over ten miles. The Rostrevor giant flung the stone now at Templetown at the Templetown giant while the Templetown giant hurled the now famed Cloughmore stone at the Rostrevor giant from Templetown.

He was the owner of three farms at that time, and was also the owner of a mill, for the manufacturing of artificial manure called bone manure.  He used to collect all the bones that could be had for that purpose.Once a week he sent his men and horses to Cork for the raw material which was imported from a foreign country for the manufacturing of this manure.  The farmers found it very profitable more especially for the growing of the turnip crop, but they also used it for other purposes and in most cases it gave a great return.  It was far more advantageous to the farmer and gave a better result than the artificial manure that is manufactured at the present day.\n", "school_info": "School: An Gleant\u00e1n, Lombardstown", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Glantane, Co.
