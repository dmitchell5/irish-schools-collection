October 24th 1938.We have a churn at home.  It is a small one.  It is about two feet high, and it is two feet wide at the bottom and one foot wide at the top.It consists of a lid dash, and a handle.  We churn twice a week in Winter, and three times in Summer.  The churn is scalded and it is left to dry.  Then it is rinsed with cold water.  Then the cream is put into the churn, and the lid is put on.  A little water nearly boiling is put into the churn in the Winter to make it churn quicker.  It is taken out of the churn when little bits of butter begin to swim on top of the buttermilk.  Then the buttermilk is taken out, it is given yo the calves or it is kept for making bread.  Sometimes people wash their faces in it.  The butter is taken out with a butter plate, and it is put into the wooden butter dish.  The water is bruised out of it by the butter pats.  Then it is made into rolls and it is put into a butter plate if it is hard, but if it is soft it is left in the butter dish, and water is put on it.  Before it is made into rolls salt is mixed with it.There are also barrel churns.  The various parts of them are the lid, the barrel, handle, and stand.

It is wider at the top and at the bottom than in the centre. The instruments used when churning are, the churns, the churns dash, the cup, and the lid. There are two kinds of churns, dash and machine churns. The dash churn is mostly used as it was recently machine churns were made.     According to the condition of the cream and the temperature of the weather, the time taken to do a churning varies. It takes a longer time in winter than in summer. Before the churning is begun a pinch of salt is put into the churn. This is done to prevent the butter from being stolen. The butter is formed by working the dash up and down. In a machine churn it is done by turning a handle. This is very tiring on the arms especially if the person is not used to it.

Many of the old people tell us that it is not right to bring out a coal[?] while the churning is going on. If a stranger comes into a house where the people are churning it is right for him to churn for a few minutes. Any person who churns on New Years Day will get no butter.

When the butter is made it gather in lumps on top of the milk.  Water is poured on it sometimes.  Hot water is put on it when the milk is cold and cold when it is too hot.  The butter is lifted out with the \"Cl\u00e1ib\u00edn\" which is a little wooden bowl with a hole in it.

It is then left for a day or two until it thickens and the cream rises to the top. The churn is then got ready and the thick milk is put into it to be churned.

The rope was put into a barrel in the yard by some one and the farmer could not make butter or separate the milk for a few weeks. One day the farmer's son went to the barrel in the yard and there he saw the rope inside and it started to shake. The boy went in and called his father out and showed him the rope. His father told him to go for the priest and as they was coming in the yard they met a woman coming out the gate with the rope in her hand.

The cream is churned to make butter and the separated milk is used as feeding for calves and pigs.  The churn is washed out thoroughly with cold water.  Then the cream is put in the churn.  In the winter tepid water is added to the cream and in the summer cold water is added.  Next the lid is put on the churn by means of four screws.

In some parts of Ireland there are many superstitions practices relating to churning but I know of none here.Told by George Brennan, Mossy Glen to his son Dan.\n\n\n\nI was also told by Tom Mooney Meenletterbale that long ago people especially old women turned themselves into witches and milked the cows.  They also had power to take milk off the churns and it very often happened when people churned that no butter would be found on the churn.  These witches could be shot with a silver bullet but no one liked to shoot them because they were afraid of their power, which every one said came from the devil.written by Charles Gillen\n", "school_info": "School: Star of the Sea, Glengivney", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Glennagiveny, Co.

Another way was to run the reaping hook through the blades of grass and say \"milk and butter\".It was commonly believed when people had a large supply of milk and butter, and a few cows - that these people had what was commonly termed as \"the dead hand\".

There are three kinds of churns. They are nearly the same make but worked in a different manner. The cream is churned in one of them by working the dash up and down in it and lest the milk would come up through the lid there is a little timber cup put around the dash.The cream is churned in the other churn by turning a handle while left on a chair or table and the beaters inside the milk. The most convenient one of all which is mostly in use at present is very easily worked.  It is merely to twist the whole barrel around by means of a handle and as it twists the cream is churned by dashing from side to side. In some churns there is no need to raise the lid to know when it is churned. There is a glass in the lid and when the sign of butter comes on this piece of glass the cream is churned. This may be done in about a quarter of an hour.When cream is churned the butter milk is let out through a small hole near the bottom of the churn and if any of the butter escapes with it, it can be strained through a little sieve which\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Tobar Pheadair", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Peterswell, Co.

There are two kinds of churns an \"ordinary\" one and a \"twisting\" one. The \"ordinary\" one is three feet high. It is wide in the bottom and the top. At the \"cashuo\" which is the waist of the churn it is narrow. Its utensils are the churn-dash, dasher, print, two butter spades, lid and a wooden dish. The \"twisting\" one has the shape of a barrel and others are square. Its parts are the lid, handle, and dash. Its sides are round but the ordinary ones are straight. The butter is made twice a week in Summer and once a week in Winter. The woman of the house makes the churning and if any stranger comes in while its being made he remains within keep sin making it.

It was easy to know when the butter was made as it would be hard and tough to work the churn. Water was always poured into the churn to rinse the churn after the butter making.

They are easier to use than the barrel churns, or the churns used long ago.In this locality there is a lot of \"pise\u00f3ga\" about churning. They say that if the churning is not going on well that the fairies are under the churn. So they put a lit coal under the churn. They say it will chase the fairies away.When a stranger comes to the house while the people are churning, they will tell him or her to take a hand at the churning. They say the churning will not be good unless the stranger churns for  while.On the top of some of the churns there is a glass. When the glass is clear the people will know the butter is made.\n", "school_info": "School: Mairn\u00e9ulaigh", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Inishcrone, Co.

This was placed in a stand made for the purpose and was revolved by two persons, the people did not understand this at first, but they afterwards came to know it.

A small round peice of wood with a hole large enough for the dash to pass through is placed on the top of the lid before the churning begins. This is called a \"clab\u00e1n\" and is meant to keep the milk from splashing up in the hole in the lid.The churn is about two and a half feet high sixteen inches wide across the top and more than a foot and a half across the bottom.

It was a stick with a beater attached to one end of it. The staff was placed upright in the churn and then the lid or cover, having a round hole a little bigger in diameter than that of the handle of the staff, was put on.

It was usually a little thatched \u201cbinny\u201d at the rear of the farm house and it was kept spotlessly clean. When the milk had cooled it was put into the big milk-tube in which it was allowed to rest for four or five days before it was churned. The shape of the churn is round, narrower at top than at the bottom. The different parts of the churn are, the churn, staff, the lid and the \u201cthe Chrib\u00edn,\u201d When the housewife is about to make butter she scrubs and scalds the churn, the staff and the \u201cChrib\u00edn\u201d, then putting the milk into it and covering the tip of the churn with a clean white cloth, specially reserved for the purpose of preventing the dust from getting into the milk. Long ago when this part of the work was done it was customary to throw a little salt on the lid of the churn, making at the same time the Sign of the Cross. In the summer the churning is usually done in the morning or late in the evening because  the coolest part of the day is the right time for churning. If it were done in the middle of the day when the heat is more intense, the butter would be white, very light and soft. In the morning the family were called very early from their beds and the woman of the house put a drop of holy-water into the churn, blessed herself and struck the first \u201cgreas\u201d. While the churn was being made the doors were kept closed so that the milk might not become cold and so cause delay in the making.

It used to be an old Irish custom to put a horse-shoe under the churn for luck.\n\n\n\nLong ago people had no churning machines like now a days. The way they did their churning was by moving a staff up and down the churn. This was very heavy work when there was much milk in the churn.

The way the churning is made is first when the cow is milked the milk is placed in a basin or preferably in a crock because it thickens quicker in a crock, and then it is put into the dairy in a clean cool place, and it is left there for a few days to thicken.

The cream was placed in a deep jar to allow it ripen.The butter was produced from a churn. This was like a wooden jar bound with iron hoops. One end was narrow, and in the neck was placed a wooden disc with a hold in the centre. Through this hole a \"plunger\" of wood, with beaters at the end was placed.When the churn was ready after being properly scoured and scolded, the cream was put in, and the operator worked the plunger up and down at a uniform speed until the was broken.

Once a man in Clonavogy met one of these hares coming out of his byre. On the following day he lay in hiding near the byre and when the hare emerged from the byre, as usual, he struck the hare with a long whip and gave her such a savage blow that he cut her face & knocked out an eye. He went to a neighbour's house on the following day and found that the woman of the house had her cheek badly cut and had her eye out. He had no doubt then in his mind who the hare was -- and who was responsible for taking the milk off his cows.Some years ago it was customary for such witches to go through pasture fields where cows would be grazing especially on May morning.

It was round at the bottom and getting smaller towards the top like a tankard.  It was worked with a staff which was moved up and down.  Butter was made every day in Summer and once a week in Winter.Strangers who came in while the work was in progress gave a hand so that they would not take the butter.  The work takes about half an hour.  It is made when it is hard to move the staff, and when tiny particles show on it.  When it is finished water is poured on to wash it - this is done until the water is clear.When all this work is done the butter is taken out with 'patties' and laid on a dish.  Then it is mixed with two timber sticks called 'spades'.  After that boiling water is put into the churn to scald it.Long ago the butter was washed in a timber pan called a 'peck' and salted and mixed with a timber saucer - a 'cup'.The butter-milk is drunk and used in cakes.In warm weather it is hard to make butter, boiling water is poured in during the process to make it easy.Pina HollandGurthnagranaherFrom John Holland, 60Moig\n", "school_info": "School: Baile Stiabhna, Askeaton", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ballysteen, Co.

When she had the cows milked, she used to strain the milk and put it in keelers on a stilleen in the dairy and leave it there until the cream would be well set generally one day.  Then she would skim the cream off the top of the milk with a timber skimmer shaped like a saucer made of beech.  When she would have about one gallon of sour cream she would scald the churn and then put the cream into it.  She would then put the churn staff into the churn and put the lid on.  She would pull the churn staff up and down until the butter would be made.  This would take about a 1/4 of an hour in the Summer and 1/2 an hour in the Winter.  Then she would take out the butter with a \"skimmer\", and put it in a peck and wash it in three clear spring waters, She would put about 1/2 pound of salt to every eight pounds of butter and put it into a fircin.Whilst the churning is in progress everyone must take her turn of the work.  Even strangers or passers by had to do so.  The belief was that if you didn't you charmed away the butter out of the churn.

There are different sizes of churns ranging from one to five cow churns. The churns are not very much used now as a lot of people send to the creamery. There is a handle made of iron on each side which make it easy to lift. When the milk is thick and ready for churning my mother scalds the churn and throws in the milk. Then a few of us start and churn for about three quarters of an hour. Hot water is added to make it easy to churn. When the butter is done it is taken off and put in a baisin. Then there is salt put in to flavour it. Then it is made up into rools or prints. The lid of the churn is made round with a hole in the middle to admit the dash\n", "school_info": "School: Corcaghan", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Corcaghan, Co. Monaghan", "Teacher:": "\nF.

Cans were upright wooden vessels bound with three hoops of tin. One stave was longer than the others at the top of which was an oval shaped hole for the hand. A can would contain about four gallons of milk. The dairymaid or milk-woman generally carried this full on the head. A round pad of hair was placed on the head and the can of milk or water was placed on that and the carrier put her two hands on her hips and walked away without spilling a drop.When the cows were milked the milk was taken to the dairy and set in wooden vessels called keelers. These were round, about two feet in diameter, sometimes more and sometimes less. They were about seven inches or less in depth.Two opposite staves were higher than the rest in which were bored bwo holes for the fingers.The milk was not disturbed for about thirty six hours when the cream would have come to the top and would have become thick and firm.The milk-maid skimmed the cream into the cream tub either with her fingers or with a skimmer, a sort of wooden saucer.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Baile an Londraigh (B.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ballylanders, Co.

The beater churn is still to be seen in many of the old houses.The dash churn consisted of a large tub with a lid on it. ~There was a hole in the centre for the dash to go into. Then the dash was brought up and down until the butter was nearly made. Then it was given a slow rolling motion from side to side until the butter was entirely made. The new turn over churn is on a stand and there is a handle in it for turning it around. On the lid is a small round piece of glass and when the cream is churned the glass gets bright and the butter is made. When the butter was made it was washed twice to get out all the butter milk. The it was salted. In summer butter is made twice a week and a quantity of cold water is added while churning. In winter butter is only made once a week and tepid water is often used during the process.

Then the buttermilk is washed out of it with water, but sometimes it is squeezed out of it with the butter-spades. It is then salted and the salt is mixed well through it so as no part of it will be left unsalted. Sometimes it is made into oblong-shaped lumps\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Ardaghy, Omeath", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Ardaghy, Co. Louth", "Teacher:": "\nB.

People churn often in summer because milk is more plentiful then, than in winter. In winter there is less churning because milk is not so plentiful as in summer.If a stranger comes in when churning is in process it is customary for them to help. It is said that this will put luck on the butter. In summer it takes about ten minutes to do the churning, and in winter a half-hour.When the butter is made the glass becomes clear. Water is poured in when the churning is nearly finished. My mother pours in cold in summer to harden the butter. In winter she pours hot water in to soften itTo make up the butter you let out the buttermilk into a crock through the tap. Then water is poured in to wash the milk of the butter.

The money was given in payment of the rent to the landlord.  Long ago, witches  used to take the butter off the milk.  There is not any of that happening now.  In spring when the farmers used to be working out, they would send someone to a house nearby for a coal.  If the people of that house were churning at that time they wouldn't give the coal as the butter might be given away.  If a person came into a house where there would be churning going on, he would give a few pulls to the dash.  When the hand is left on the dash the power of the witch is broken.Our churn is over four feet high.  It is wider in the bottom and is getting narrower as it reaches the middle.  From the centre to the top it is gettng wider again.  This churn was made by a \"cooper\" in Derrylahan in the year 1907.  When it was first got it was filled with hay and boiling water poured into it.  It can churn over five crocks of milk.  The dash was made at the same time.  Churning is done by pulling the dash up and down.  All the people in the house help at the work.  At last, when the dash is seen coming up clear the work is done.

It is suppose to take twenty and but sometimes it takes five minutes  and other times over an hour. If there is thunder in the air it takes much longer. The churning is done by hand. Sometimes people know when the butter is made by the noise in the churn. Water is often poured in to make it churn quicker. The butter is lifted out with a wooden bat and it is put in a wooden bowl.

Men with large herds of cows got the churning machine which was worked by horse power. Within the last twenty years the churning system has greatly improved as the latest churn now is known as the \"end over end\". This is the most suitable way of churning because at the present day anybody can work this churn. They can sit down on their chairs and work this churn with their feet on the same scale as one peddels a bicycle. These churns are the same as are used in the all cremeries except that one is worked by hand and foot and the other is worked by machinery. It is quite easy to know when the butter is half or fully churned. When milk is half churned the butter becoms a thick curd and stickey, sticking to the side of the churn and when the old \"dash\" was being used by sticking to the handle of the \"dash\". By contuinuing to churn about fifteen minutes longer this stickeyness increases and this curd became a soild mass of butter, losing its stickeyness to the churn and floated on the top of the milk. The farmer's wife or the dairymaid had nothing to do but to lift it off the milk into a large wooden dish in which she salted it to a normal degree. She then made it into pounds, two pounds and as high as six pound three cornered rolls. Others put it down in firkins. Firkins are little tubs without handles. In the olden days if a stranger came to a house when the churning was on he would have to take the \"dash\" of the church and say \"God bless the milk and the butter\" and give it a few dashes.\n", "school_info": "School: Ceannanus M\u00f3r, Scoil na mBr\u00e1thar", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Kells, Co.

Large churns with \"beaters\" attached and driven by horse-power have been used in many farmhouses, the motive power being adapted from the machinery of the old threshing mills.\n\n\n\nChurning or butter-making is a home industry, common to all the farmers in Eire. The process is very simple. The milk from the cows is placed in earthen crocks or milk pans and left there until it is considered fit for churning. This depends on the temperature in which the milk is kept. Sometimes a few days, and more times a week, will ripen the cream. It is then put into a churn and \"beaten\", and tossed until the butter gathers on the top. Several kinds of churns are used. We have the dash churn, and the diabols churn. The butter is then taken off the milk. The butter is then beaten in order to get rid of the milk.

These varied from three to five feet in height, broad shaped a the bottom similar to the metal churns in which the farmers carry their milk to the creamery. They were fitted with a wooden lid in the centre of which a circular hole was pierced. Through this aperture the staff was passed and worked up and down by hand. This motion eventually makes the butter.Next came a sort of barrel which was placed on a stand. This barrel had revolving beaters, and the motion of the handle on the outside twisted the beaters while the barrel remained stationary.

They were called 'fan churns'.  We have a churn at home.  It is a small one called a 'fan churn'.  It holds about two gallons of cream.  In winter time it is harder to churn than in the Summer time.  When the cream is churned you strain the buttermilk off.  You next wash the butter clean.  Then you salt it and leave it for one hour.  Then you make it into rools and it is ready for use.  In olden times the people were very superstitious about churning.  If a stranger came in while they were churning they would have to take a turn at the churn and say \"God bless it\" before leaving the house.There is a story told in this locality of a man who went into a house where a woman was churning to lit his pipe.  He was then leaving the house without saying \"God bless the churn\" or taking a turn at it.

Most farmhouses have dairies now & strangers or neighbours do not come near the dairy.  Formerly, when churning was done in the kitchen, anyone who came was expected to help - else they might \"take the profit\".  Churning takes usually from 20 mins to 1 hour.  The churning is done by hand and the direction is reversed from time to time.  All end over churns are used.  When the little glass fitted into the lid \"clears\" the butter has come.  The churn is then stirred very very gently till the grains are seen to be the size of a grain of wheat - when it is \"done\".  In cold weather water is sometimes poured in, but it must be cooled boiled water or the temp. must on no account be raised above 60% or it will be \"scalded\" i.e. the germ killed.  Sometimes the butter remains in tiny grains & wont \"go together\".  A little luke warm water added then helps to collect it.  The peg is taken out & the buttermilk let out into a vessel, being passed thro' a hair sieve so that all grains are caught.  The peg is replaced.  Clean cold water is poured in & the mass is moved about in the churn, then the milky water is strained off.  This is repeated till the water runs off clear.

Water is put in after a little while churning. Hot water is put to help to churn it. The butter is lifted out with a butter scoop. They are made of wood put into a butter dish. In olden times if people went around and gathered the buttercup off your hand it was believed they took your butter. The butter milk is used for making bread and whey. It is given to calves and pigs sometimes. It is given also to fowl.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Rathmore, Tullow", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Rathmore, Co.

There is a small glass on the lid of the churn, and when that is clear, the milk is churned.

Two or more farmers joined in the filling \"of firkins\" - a wooden vessel which was capable of holding about seventy pounds of butter. They both churned on the same day. & their combined products were salted, weighed, and packed. When they had sufficient to form a horse-load, it was taken by road to Cork & sold. When properly corned - the butter was in perfect condition after as long as six months. The buyers tested the butter by means of an augur - forced right through & jerked upwards. It was then tasted & graded. There were as many as six grades of butter in the Cork market & the price of the first was almost double that of the most inferior.    There were other classes of buyers - often farmers - who bought butter - for the purpose of increasing the weight & re-selling.
