It is situated up in the heart of many high mountains, and is far from sight of any house. It is now overgrown with gorse and grass and the living creatures to be seen within a mile of it are the rabbits and hares of the countryside. The story following tells why it is avoided so much.A man was one dark night returning from visiting a friend. He was rather a stranger to the place and therefore the history of the quarry was unknown to him. Coming near his home however he was unlucky enough to lose his way. He wandered on and on not knowing where he was. Presently it began to rain, and running for shelter he happened to run into the quarry. When the rain ceased and he arose to continue his journey he was astonished to find himself being pushed back again. Effort after effort was made, but in vain.

There was a mist that night and the man went astray.  He was found dead the next morning about one mile from his own house.

When he was going down these hills he never felt them a bit. He thought he was in a lovely place. While he was going along he could hear lovely singing and talking. He never felt until he was struck up against Knappa Church.
