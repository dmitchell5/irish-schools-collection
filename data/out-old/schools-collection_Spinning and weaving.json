Blankets were also made from wool and rugs too when the wool was dyed.Long ago there was a spinning wheel in almost every house in the district and as the women spun they could be heard singing as they spun. The garments that were spun were much warmer and lasted longer than those woven presently.  Spinning wheels were long ago made by a man in the district and were therefore easily purchased.In those days money was scarce and hard earned and that is why almost all the clothes that were worn were not bought but home-made.\n", "school_info": "School: Bellanagare", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Bellanagare, Co.

The dye used in this case was log-wood and copperas. Great care had to be exercised in the use of this dye. Copperas being a mineral was liable to damage the material if too much of it was used.

In the centre of the lid on the top of the churn there was a round hole about two inches in diameter and through this hole there was a long stick or handle with a cross fastened at the bottom end and in this way by pulling the stick upward and then thrusting it downward the cream was worked into butter.  When the butter was made some farmers sent it off as fresh butter to the market in boxes.  Other farmers cured it and packed it into firkins.
