He had a wonderful store of traditional lore and of local history.A few men were out one hot Summer's day levelling a 'ditch' between two fields.  They found a weasel's nest with young ones in it at the root of a bush and they flung out the nest along with the stones and roots which were embedded in the ditch.  Shortly afterwards one of the men noticed the two old weasels running towards a can of buttermilk which the men had brought out to the field with them.  The weasels jumped up on the rim of the can, spat into it and then made off as quickly as they came.  After talking the matter over the men decided to put back the nest in its original place.  They restored it as well as they could and placed the young weasels in it.  Suddenly the old weasels appeared, made for the can of milk, placed their paws against and overturned it, spilling its contents on the ground.Note:- It was believed that the weasel's spit was poisonous.\n", "school_info": "School: St Peter's, Phibsboro", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Phibsborough, Co.

Even the occupants of a farmhouse in the precincts of which a 'Buck' is kept carry about them this most disagreeable odour.  Farmers say that this odour is due to a peculiar habit of the animal namely that of eating excrement.\n\n\n\nThe Hedgehog:It is believed in the Farney District that the hedgehog is not an entirely harmless animal.

It was usually seen in the old dry ditches.A common warning in connection with the newt's dangerous propensities was current in the district during my boyhood.  One should never go asleep in an open place where man creepers might be lurking; one of them would very likely creep into your mouth and down into your stomach.A rather amusing story concerning a man creeper was frequently told in the Farney district.  It ran as follows.A man fell asleep one summer's day near an old embankment.  On awakening he realized that something was the matter with him.  The days passed by and the mysterious feeling began to alarm this man.  No one could tell what was the matter with him.

While one of them was minding the fire the other was asleep, and when he awoke he minded the fire and the other went to sleep.There was a bear living close by and it wanted to put out the fire.

It can put its tail round a branch of a tree and jump a distance of ten yards.Some forty or fifty years ago there were rumours around Grange which is a few miles from Sligo that a Cat-Martin was on the Cashnaggal mountain.

Then the dog would give a snap at them.One day a fairy came to the sheep and asked them what wish they would like granted. After considering for some time the sheep all decided that they would like the farmer's dog removed. This wish the fairy promised to grant. Night came and the sheep lay down in the field to sleep but they were soon disturbed by a strange noise.Looking all round they saw the eyes of a wolf glaring through them near the hedge. How they wished they had not asked the fairy to take away the dogs. Just then the dogs appeared and drove away the wolf.

No harm ever came as the garment however till one of the maids scalded a cricket, and the next morning the knees were eaten out of Tom's trousers. Robins and swallows are supposed to be lucky.

It is within the  present parish of Manister ) The otter weighed either   fifty-five or fifty seven pounds. Jack Griffin, my informant recalls the weight by being uncertain as to whether a one-pound  weight was put on the scale pan with a half-hundred weight to balance the otter or whether it was put in with the otter to counter balance the half-hundred weight. Mr Creed of Bruff weighed the otter and had it on show for two or three days. A number of people visited his place to view the monster. It mush have approached the record in weight. They have no idea as to its length or girth, but say \"it was more like a fat pig in size, than an otter\". I record the event solely because of the unusual weight of the amphibian and because I had the impression that a forty-pound otter was an extremely large one. Two that have been taken - by ML Roche, Ballynahown, Croom, within the last two months, to be precise  in September 1935, weighed 27 and 28 pounds respectively, the heavier one having an over-all length of forty-nine inches.

However, the origin of this custom of going round the graveyard with the coffin, was explained to me - as he had heard it explained when a boy - by John Farrell, 74 years, Manager, Croom Mills.  He says, that when \"The wolf was very plentiful in Ireland, they used often make a descent on newly made graves, tear them open and bring forth and devour the remains.  In order to throw the wolf off the scent, the remains therefore, were carried round the graveyard before being interred, and in order to baffle the wolf still further, a blanket of sod from the field, some distance away, was placed over the newly made grave, into which above the coffin were put a number of heavy stones.

Time was when the people of Parteen tied their own flies - they were all fishermen there - instead of buying them. They used this corncrake's feather rather generally and as the particular feather required is not very generously distributed on the bird's body, the demand for the particular fly incurred a heavy toll on the visiting corncrakes.  The latter were lured in a peculiar way to their death.  On the shoulder bone of a sheep, which is roughly the shape of an elongated triangle, there is a ridge of think bone, perhaps cartilage is the correct word, and when a rod is drawn across this bone ridge or cartilage, a faithful reproduction of the corncrake's mating call is produced.   The fishermen of Parteen, in groups of three or four, went to the meadows and played fiddle wise on the bone.

We had a most carnivorously minded cat, which observed the swift entering and leaving its nest.  One evening while using a lawn mower, I noticed the cat much agitated by the flight of the swifts, back from and into the nest.  In leaving it, the parent bird took a downward curve, outward from the eave, and then swung upwards again.  The cat took up its position on the ground, about what I thought, and what the cat at first thought, to be immediately under the lowest point, of the outgoing swift's flight-curve. Having done so, he waited, and next time the bird curved outward and downward, the cat sprang and missed.  He then changed his position, moving back slightly, and again sprang at the bird, when next it swung out, and again missed, and missed badly.  Indeed he was so wide of the mark, that I did not think it worth my while to chase him off reckoning that the bird could not be seized.

The flood occupies the site of the former lake. Three or four of them come at the time. They stay for a few days only. It is said that they come from Lough Gur or from the Galtee mountains. They pass over very often flying very high. A small number only fly together. They fly very high and their wings make a rushing noise. They can be heard very plainly a long time before they can be seen. When swans are flying southwards it is a sign of hard cold weather. It is generally a sign of fine weather when they go northwards.

He knew that if the hare saw him, he would make good his escape. The fox thought of a plan. He pulled a bunch of ferns and took them in his mouth and then went in the direction the hare was. The hare took no notice as the bunch of ferns hid the fox. When the fox was quite close, he dropped the ferns and jumped on his prey.The fox had a clever way for catching pheasants. The pheasant perches on a tree and on a moonlight night the fox can see her. He is unable to climb but he has a plan. He first barks to awaken the pheasant and then keeps running round the tree.

Wexford, some years ago.A small white animal covered with dark spots and it resembled a ferret in shape and it was called a Martin.  They are seldom seen.  They do great destruction to young lambs in the Spring time.  When the young lambs were lying down to sleep it stole up, took the lamb by the ear and drank the blood.  It was not seen after that.It is told that another strange animal visited the district of Askamore long ago.  It was a reindeer.  It had very long legs, and nice branchy horns about seven inches long.  It roamed the district for several days till it was captured by its owner, and brought home.A large snake also visited the district of Askamore, captured by Rev. Fr. Hickey on the road between Carnew and Coolboy.  It measured five feet long and how it came there remained a mistery.\n", "school_info": "School: Askamore", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Askamore, Co.
