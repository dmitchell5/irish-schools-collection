She did so and towards morning heard what she thought was her own children crying. She went upstairs to her rooms and found the children fast asleep. As she was about to leave the room she heard the crying again and this time it seemed to be downstairs. She went down, opened the door, looked out but couldn't see anything still the crying went on and now it seemed to be upstairs again. She went into the dying boy's room, and told the story to his sister who said, as she burst out crying \"Never mind the crying. It is the Banshee coming for poor Eddie.

I also heard other people saying that they heard the banshee and it always foretold the death of some person.I had a strange personal experience in this connection. On the night of the 14th of March 1919 (the time of the big flu  epidemic) my sister and I went out at 10 o'clock to get some turf to \"rake the fire\". Suddenly we heard a most unearthly cry. It started about a mile away from us and ran along the ground for about half a mile away from us and ran along the ground for about half a mile. Then it began to ascend and went up, up, up getting fainter as it went until it dies away in the sky. We never heard anything so weird and concluded that it must be the banshee. We went home and told our people that we heard a banshee. They laughed at us.

Many people are said to have heard the mournful, dirge, especially in lonely places.An old neighbour once informed me that as he was returning to his home late on a Winter's night, this lonely wailing was borne to his ears, coming nearer all the time until at last he could hear the pattering of feet beside him, but could perceive nothing.At last the Banshee, after having journeyed for about two miles by his side, departed and crossed the fields to the house of a person who was then dying.  In the old times it was the custom, at the death of a person, to keen over the body, but this custom has died out.  The Banshee has never been seen by anybody and though the name bade us to believe that a woman performs this wailing, it is not probable that such a person exists.The dirge is said to be sung at the death of a person whose name is preceded by Mc or O, but this is not altogether credible.  However, even the greatest of Irish chieftains such as the O'Neills and O'Donnells believed in the custom of such a supernatural being and at the death of any member of those great clans, the Banshee is said to have chanted the requiem.\n", "school_info": "School: Cill D\u00edoma (C.)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Kildimo, Co.

I don't mean that every person believes in her but a very great many do.  I have endeavoured to get as many \"Banshee\" stories as possible but I discredit a lot of them as I do not rely sufficiently on the word of the persons who say they saw the Banshee.The following story about the Banshee is perfectly and undoubtedly true.  It comes from Mrs. Peter McKenna, through her daughter, Mrs. Mason.Mrs. McKenna had a sister who was dying and one night \"they\" were sitting around the fire bewailing.  Mrs. McKenna was unmarried at the time and was young.  Her sister who died was only 18 years.  As they sat at the fire they heard a car pass by and immediately afterwards they heard the most awful screams.  They all jumped up and opened the door and looked out thinking \"a child or someone\" had fallen out of the car.  Her brother Johnnie went out on the road but the car had gone on and the screaming ceased.  After waiting a considerable length he returned to the house and shut the door.  Immediately the crying, wailing, and screaming started again, but this time quite close to the house.  He went out again, but it ceased again.  On returning again it began again and a third time he went out.  After that \"it\" went round and round the house getting worse and worse and they at last knew it was \"The Banshee\".  No one was brave enough now to open the door or go it.  It went on at intervals during the night.  Towards morning it seemed weaker and farther away and finally ceased.  The next day the girl died.\n", "school_info": "School: Clonyhurk", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Clonyhurk, Co. Offaly", "Teacher:": "\nJ.
