It is supposed to be possessed by any one of the surname 'Marrinan' or their descendants. How they inherited this peculiar power or failure is a mystery but that every member of the above surname possessed it is beyond any doubt in this locality.They are supposed to have the power to kill or inflict permanent injury on any person or beast they remark, especially if the person or beast is \"the flower of the flock\".The first Marrinan to come to this side of the Count is supposed to come ashore in the townland of Freagh, Miltown-Malbay from a ship which was wrecked in the bay. Certainly if any credence can be given to this tale they have increased and multiplied at a rapid rate because we have now one out of every ten families in a radius of ten miles around having this name. The rushes of the fields were the first living thing to suffer the effect of this 'blasting eye' hence the withered appearance of the rushes at periods of the year.Strange to say that the eye does its damage without the consent of the will of the person who possesses it and fails to do so if the owner wishes it. They even inflict injury to themselves.So many stories are told in this connection that it is impossible to select however here are a few.A young woman named 'Frawley' had her cows milked very early one Sunday morning. She was carrying home the milk in a timber-can (such vessels much used some time ago now rarely seen) which she carried on top of her head.
