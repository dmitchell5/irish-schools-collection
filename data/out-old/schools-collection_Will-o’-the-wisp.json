At the end of the six months the devil came for Willie. Willie was busy when the devil came putting hoops on a tub and he told the devil to rest himself in the chair till he was ready. When Willie had the job finished he told the devil he was ready to go but the devil could not rise from the chair. He squealed and \u2013but it was no good so he told Willie that if he could release him he would give him six months more and another hundred pounds Willie let him go then. At the end of the second six months the devil came again and willie said that he would go with him when he had finished sledging a piece of iron. He asked the devil to help him sledge and when they had finished Willie said he was ready to go. But the devil could not let go the sledge. He shouted and roared and shook his hands but it was no good he could not drop the sledge so he told Willie he would give him another six months and another hundred pounds if he would take the sledge from his hands. Willie took the sledge from him and the Devil went.  At the end of the third six months the devil came again and this time he would neither sit in the chair or sledge to iron for Willie so that in the long run Willie had to go with him. As they were passing a public house willie saw two men drinking and he said to the devil \u201cset those two men drunk and you can take them with you too, for it is easy for the devil to take drunken men.\u201d \u2018That is a good idea\u2019 said the devil \u201cbut I have no money.\u201d \u201cMusha\u201d said willie \u201cyou a poor devil if that\u2019s any trouble to you I hear you can change yourself into many shapes and surely you can change yourself into a florin\" So the devil changed himself into a florin and Willie put him into his purse and went home. The devil cried and shouted and said he would give thousands of pound and a whole life time to Willie if he would let him go. But Willie was not satisfied with that. He took the purse to the forge and placed it on the anvil and began to sledge it for all he was worth. The devil began to roar and said hilt or hair of him would never be seen in the world again if Willie would let him go. So Willie let him go and he never troubled him after. Willie lived to be very old and when he died he went up to heaven to get in. But St Peter met him at the gate and said he could not come there as he sold himself to the devil when on earth and to go to him now. So Willie had to go down to hell but when the devil saw him coming he was in a terrible state and he had all the devils working for all they were worth shutting the gates, locking them and building up fires against them. When Willie arrived at the gates the devil shouted that he would not let him in, that he would play some trick on them and told him to go back and St Peter again refused him. Then Willie tried to force his way in and St Peter threw a lighted candle at willie. TH candle struck Willie and knocked him down on the earth through the sky. When Willie was falling he caught the lighted candle and ever since at night he is flying around with his lighted candle and in the day time he blows the dust+ straws and thraunins up in the air and is called Willie the Wisp.\n(continues on next page)\n", "school_info": "School: Drumloughan (Dromlachan)", "metadata": [{"Location:": "Sunnagh More, Co.
