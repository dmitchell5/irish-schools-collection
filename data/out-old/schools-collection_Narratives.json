He stopped to listen and remained spell-bound while the song lasted.When the song ended he turned back towards the Monastery and found it in ruins.  He was more than astonished and going along he met an old man and asked him what had happened to the Monastery.  The old man told the monk that he did not know what exactly happened but that it had been in ruins for 400 years.The monk then told the old man his story and the people say that the story is proof of the shortness of time and the length of eternity.
